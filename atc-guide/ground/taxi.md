# Taxi



Taxiing is when aircraft maneuver on the ground under their own power. This is usually to get from the gate to the departure runway, or after landing to get from the runway to the gate.



Step 1

: When an aircraft requests taxi, the aircraft symbol will flash amber on the map as well as their callsign on the flight progress strip



Step 2

: Either tap the aircraft on the map (and then "Other Message"), or the flight progress strip to bring up the communication menu



Step 3

: Tap "Taxi to > [select RWY]"



Tip

: Dependant on traffic, a taxi command may need to be immediately followed with progressive taxi or give way instructions



## Progressive Taxi and Give Way

As well as using the normal taxi commands, progressive taxi and give way instructions can be useful to help assist the Controller with ground management, particularly with one way systems, potential conflicts, and intersection departures.



Manual

: "Taxi to RWYXX, contact tower when ready" and "Taxi to parking" are the default commands that **must**{.red} be used by Controllers for the purposes of departing/arriving aircraft. [More info?](/guide/atc-manual/2.-ground/2.2-taxi-and-use-of-give-way#2.2.2)

**Give Way Commands**

Step 1

: In the event of a potential conflict, tap the aircraft that you want to take corrective action. You can do this by tapping the aircraft on the map (and then "Other Message"), or by tapping their flight progress strip



Step 2

: This will bring up the communication menu, tap "Give way to > [select appropriate reference to other aircraft]"



Step 3

: Once the conflict is clear, the aircraft giving way can continue as cleared



**Progressive Taxi Commands**

Step 1

: In the event that progressive taxi instructions are required (e.g. complicated layout or potential conflict), tap the aircraft that you want to direct. You can do this by tapping the aircraft on the map (and then "Other Message"), or by tapping their flight progress strip



Step 2

: This will bring up the communication menu. After issuing the normal taxi clearance (i.e. taxi to RWYXX or taxi to parking), tap "Progressive Taxi > [select appropriate directions]"



Step 3

: Once you have completed the progressive taxi instructions, tap "Progressive Taxi > Continue taxi at your discretion" to allow the aircraft to continue on their own
