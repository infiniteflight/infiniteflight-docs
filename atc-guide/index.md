# Welcome to the ATC Guide!



## Guide Version: 21.4.0



Whether you're a novice with no aviation background, or a professional controller with thousands of hours under your belt; our ATC Guide has been designed to help you with all aspects of controlling in Infinite Flight. 



It is important to note that the ATC Guide focuses on *controlling techniques* rather than the rules (see [The ATC Manual](/guide/atc-manual)) - therefore the "scenarios" are deliberately "gray" rather than "black & white" to help Controllers think outside the box!
