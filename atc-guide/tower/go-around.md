# Go-Around



A Go-Around (G/A) is an aborted landing by an aircraft on final approach and can either be initiated by the pilot or ATC.



Possible reasons to Go-Around can include:



- Loss of separation with the aircraft ahead
- Landing/intersecting runway blocked by another aircraft
- or an unstable approach (both pilot induced or due to environmental factors)



It is important to note that the responsibility for a go-around lies equally with the pilot and the controller, if ATC is present.



Manual

: If working with a Radar Controller, you **should**{.red} try to let them know that the aircraft is "go-around" traffic so that they can work them into the plan, the aircraft can then be handed over to the Radar Controller unless they are VFR traffic or a prior arrangement has been made between Controllers.

+++ SCENARIO - Go-Around Avoidance

::: scenario-heading
Scenario
:::

::: scenario
Both *N1DC* and *I-DRUM* are on final for RWY05L. With minimum separation and an Approach Speed difference in excess of 80kts, the possibility of a go-around is high.

| Technique 1                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1: Try to anticipate the problem by creating separation sooner rather than later |
| 2: If both aircraft were downwind, rather than allowing *I-DRUM* to follow *N1DC* with minimum separation, you could instruct *I-DRUM* to "extend downwind, I'll call your base" to build more separation in between the two aircraft |

| Technique 1 | Pro or Con?                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| :fa-check-circle: | Could prevent a go-around |
| :fa-times-circle: | May increase workload |

| Technique 2                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1: Instruct *I-DRUM* to "maintain slowest practical speed"   |
| 2: Once *N1DC* has landed and is at a sensible speed, you can instruct them to exit the runway expeditiously (if it is a full-stop) |

| Technique 2 | Pro or Con?                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| :fa-check-circle: | Could prevent a go-around |
| :fa-times-circle: | May cause separation issues with other aircraft on final |
{.prosandcons}




| Technique 3                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1: If you have multiple runways available, you could change the runway that *I-DRUM* is cleared for |
| 2: Instruct *I-DRUM* to "enter straight in RWY 05R"          |
| 3: Re-clear *I-DRUM* for RWY05R with the appropriate traffic pattern instruction if it is a touch & go |
{.technique}
| Technique 3       | Pro or Con?                                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| :fa-check-circle: | Good use of all available runways               |
| :fa-times-circle: | May increase Pilot workload and cause confusion |

Tip

: There is nothing wrong with a go-around but it is the final defence - if you can prevent this by being proactive then great!
