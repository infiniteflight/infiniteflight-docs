# Inbounds



## Pattern Entry, Sequence and Clearance

[INSERT CONTENT]



![The Traffic Pattern](_images/manual/graphics/atc-traffic-pattern.png)



Manual

: When there is no Radar Controller present, Tower **must**{.red} issue a pattern entry and clearance to **ALL**{.red} aircraft as a **MINIMUM**{.red}, regardless of what the aircraft uses to check in on the Tower frequency - the use of sequencing will be dependent on traffic. [More Info?](/guide/atc-manual/3.-tower/3.3-inbounds#3.3.1)

+++ SCENARIO - Multiple Inbounds

::: scenario-heading
Scenario
:::

::: scenario
Multiple aircraft have just announced inbound but the Controller is unsure on what order to sequence them in.

| Technique 1                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Only send a pattern entry to the aircraft you are unsure about in terms of sequencing |
| Wait until the aircraft are closer, and once certain of their sequence, issue this along with their clearance |

{.technique}

| Technique 1       | Pro or Con?                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| :fa-check-circle: | Offers flexibility                                           |
| :fa-check-circle: | Ensures aircraft know who they are following                 |
| :fa-times-circle: | May increase workload as you have to send two separate commands |

{.prosandcons}




| Technique 2                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Send a pattern entry and the most likely sequence to all aircraft |
| Monitor and if required, change the sequence as they get closer |

{.technique}

| Technique 2       | Pro or Con?                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| :fa-check-circle: | Good for workload management                                 |
| :fa-times-circle: | Aircraft may be unsure who they are following if the sequence is given too early |

{.prosandcons}



Tip

: Work from the inside out by making sure that all aircraft closest to the airport have been given a pattern entry, sequence (unless they are number 1) and clearance. Then progressively work your way out to all the other aircraft!

## Runway Changes

[INSERT CONTENT]



Manual

: If a runway change is issued, a new pattern entry and clearance **must**{.red} be given (the use of sequencing will be dependent on traffic). [More Info?](/guide/atc-manual/3.-tower/3.3-inbounds#3.3.3)



+++ SCENARIO - Runway Changes

::: scenario-heading
Scenario
:::

::: scenario
*VP-MAX* is departing RWY32L and *I F A E Eleven* is departing RWY32R. Both departures happened simultaneously. *I F A E Eleven* then asks for a RWY change to RWY32L.
::: 

![](_images/manual/screens/atcg-pw-runway-change.png){.scenario}

| Technique 1                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Instruct *I F A E Eleven* to "enter right downwind RWY32L, number 2, traffic to follow is on left downwind” |
| If you are concerned about a conflict on the other end, then you can also tell *I F A E Eleven* to "extend downwind, I'll call your base" to alleviate this |
| When you clear *I F A E Eleven*, you can then give them left traffic if you wish to do so to move them onto that side for subsequent patterns |

{.technique}

| Technique 1       | Pro or Con?                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| :fa-check-circle: | Offers flexibility                          |
| :fa-times-circle: | May cause confusion on who is following who |

{.prosandcons}




| Technique 2                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Instruct *VP-MAX* to "turn crosswind”                        |
| When you are happy with the separation, tell *I F A E Eleven* to "enter left downwind for RWY32L, number 2, traffic to follow is on left downwind” |
| If during this time, *I F A E Eleven* starts a right turn for RWY32R, then adopt Technique 1 instead |

{.technique}

| Technique 2       | Pro or Con?                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| :fa-check-circle: | Ensures separation between both aircraft                     |
| :fa-times-circle: | *I F A E Eleven* may start the turn onto a right downwind before you have time to give the new pattern entry |

{.prosandcons}




| Technique 3                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Instruct *I F A E Eleven* "extend upwind, I'll call your crosswind” |
| Wait until separation between *VP-MAX* and *I F A E Eleven* is adequate (you can expedite this by telling *VP-MAX* to "turn crosswind"), and then tell *I F A E Eleven* to "enter left downwind for RWY32L, number 2, traffic to follow is on left downwind” |
| The new pattern entry supersedes the previous instruction    |

{.technique}

| Technique 3       | Pro or Con?                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| :fa-check-circle: | Prevents *I F A E Eleven* from entering right downwind       |
| :fa-times-circle: | May add confusion when a pattern entry is used instead of "turn crosswind" |

{.prosandcons}



Tip

: Remember that other variables (such as terrain) might influence what is the best technique to use on the day, be flexible!
