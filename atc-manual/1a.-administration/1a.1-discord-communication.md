# 1A.1  Discord Communication

 

Tip

: Infinite Flight app related issues can be discussed within the IFATC Discord Channels for advice; however, for official support, the [IFC Forum](https://community.infiniteflight.com/c/support/17) **must**{.red} be used



## General

### 1A.1.1    

Discord is a messenger app for teams to make work simpler, more pleasant and more productive. More information on how this app works can be found [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us).

 

### 1A.1.2

 The channels and their use is outlined in the table below:

| Channel                | Purpose                                                      |
| ---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| #atc-schedule          | The ATC Schedule briefing room channel can be used to brief/plan anything related to featured airports on any given day |
| #announcements         | Official Infinite Flight updates (such as new blog updates, new versions of the ATC Manual, and Beta information) to be made in this channel by the ATC Manager, Staff and Moderators only |
| #botcommands           | All bot commands **should**{.red} only be used in this channel. *!command* can be typed in this channel to bring up a list of available commands for use *(see [1A.1.3](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.1-discord-communication#1a.1.3) below)* |
| #controllers           | All normal Controller communications to occur in this channel. This channel **should not**{.red} be used unless **ACTIVELY** controlling. Controllers can use the abbreviations found below this table when sending opening/closing messages instead of the full facility names if they prefer to do so |
| #discussions           | This is a channel for active Controllers to engage in discussion regarding IFATC, ATC, Infinite Flight, and aviation. Controllers that are **CURRENTLY** open **should not**{.red} be conversing in this channel unless operationally critical |
| #events                | The Events briefing room channel may be used to coordinate official and unofficial events such as FF, GA Day and streams |
| #flights               | This channel is used for Controllers to coordinate group flights together. All coordination **should**{.red} remain in this channel |
| #help-request          | If Controllers require support that cannot be found elsewhere, they can "raise" a ticket in this channel by reacting to the relevant role *(for further guidance see [1A.2.4](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.2-discord-rules#1a.2.4) below)* |
| #important-info        | Useful links as well as the Terms & Conditions that **must**{.red} be accepted by "reacting" before access is granted to the rest of the server |
| #infinite-flight-rules | Highlights where to find the rules of the IFATC Discord server |
| #offtopic              | This is a channel to discuss things unrelated to IFATC or Infinite Flight. All conversations **should**{.red} remain appropriate. *#offtopic* is a privilege and all members are subject to removal at any time if misused. This is for active members only |
| #readonly              | Day to day posts (such as housekeeping and event specific procedures) to be made in this channel by the ATC Manager, Staff and Moderators only |
| #role-assignments      | Within this channel is a "notification opt in" menu - Controllers can react with the corresponding emoji to opt in and when the mentioned phrase is used, the Controller will receive a notification. Controllers that use the mentioned phrase **must**{.red} only use it when necessary to avoid spamming other Controllers *(see [1A.3.1](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.3-controller-rules#1a.3.1) below)* |
| #screenshots           | This is a place to share Infinite Flight screenshots (in moderation). No other simulator, games, or off-topic content **must**{.red} be shared and all screenshots **should**{.red} be of a high quality |
| #social-media          | Automated official Infinite Flight social media updates. Controllers **must not**{.red} reply to any material posted in this channel so that all Controllers can be reached effectively |
| #training-time         | Trainers will post in this channel when they require pilots to join in for training sessions *(see [7.1.5](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.1-overview#7.1.5) below)* |



> When Controllers send opening/closing messages, the following letters/abbreviations can be used if Controllers find it more convenient than using the full facility names:
>
> - G - Ground
>
> - T - Tower
> - S - ATIS
> - A or App - Approach
> - D or Dep - Departure
> - C or Center - Center
>
> e.g. "EGLL GTS open"



## Bot Commands

### 1A.1.3

By typing "/" into the Discord message bar, a list of commands will be generated that can be used for various functions. 



## Voice Channels

### 1A.1.4

Voice Channels (VCs) **must**{.red} only be used in accordance with the Discord Rules *(see [1A.2.1](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.2-discord-rules#1a.2.1) below)*. Controllers who are operating an airport independently without assistance **should not**{.red} claim a VC unless:

- the control positions are split (e.g. passing Ground control to another member whilst still operating Tower)
- a Radar Controller opens at the airport
- and/or all facility Controllers opt to communicate via a VC in the *#controllers* Discord channel



### 1A.1.5

The use of VCs is **not required**{.red} and is at the sole discretion of the Controller (there may be select events where the use of VCs is required to guarantee operational efficiency - if this is the case, Controllers that do not wish to use voice may have to control elsewhere). Controllers who wish to observe others in a VC for educational purposes may **ONLY** do so if **ALL** operational Controllers in the VC have given consent. Observers **must not**{.red} distract from the active ATC operation and **should**{.red} remain muted.



### 1A.1.6

To open a VC, the following steps are to be followed:



Step 1

: Open the IFATC Discord and using the navigation bar on the left side of the screen, find the "Controlling" tab



Step 2

: Under this, click "Select to Create VC", a new VC will be created with you as the owner of that channel. It will automatically be titled with your Discord username



Step 3

: The VC title **must**{.red} then be changed to an appropriate* name so that it is clear to other Controllers what the VC purpose is *(see [1A.1.7](https://infiniteflight.com/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.1-discord-communication#1a.1.7) below)* 



**An appropriate name is one that provides no ambiguity - the standard or preferred naming is to use the ICAO code of the airport being controlled (e.g. EGPH) however if more than one airport is being controlled in a particular VC, then a more generic title can be chosen (e.g. New York Area, Oceanic Centers, Dubai Flyout Event etc.)*



Tip

: Only the owner of the VC can change the name or user limit *(see [1A.1.7](https://infiniteflight.com/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.1-discord-communication#1a.1.7) below)* 



### 1A.1.7

Below are the commands that can be used in the *#botcommands* Discord channel to manage a VC:



| Commands                    | Purpose                                             |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| !voice-claim @[username]    | Claim ownership of the VC                           |
| !voice-limit [number]       | Change the user limit of the VC (the default is 10) |
| !voice-owner                | Will inform you who is the current owner of the VC  |
| !voice-rename [ICAO code]   | Rename the VC                                       |
| !voice-transfer @[username] | *Transfer ownership of the VC                       |

**Ownership can only be transferred to Controllers that are in the VC. VC owners **should**{.red} ensure that ownership is transferred before leaving the VC to avoid the channel being closed (channels will automatically close when vacant for 1 minute)*



### 1A.1.8

Below are some useful tips for VCs:

- You can see how many members currently occupy a VC at any time by noting the [00/10] channel count
- Selecting "Mute" (microphone symbol) means no one can hear you
- Selecting "Deafen" (headphones symbol) means you don't hear anyone else
- Always double check your sound settings (i.e. Input = Mic and Output = Speaker)
- Connecting to a VC will act much like a phone call and can run in the background whilst controlling
