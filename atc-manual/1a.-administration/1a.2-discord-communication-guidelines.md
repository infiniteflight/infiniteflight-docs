# 1A.2  Discord Communication Guidelines

 

Tip

: Infinite Flight app related issues can be discussed within the IFATC Discord Channels for advice; however, for official support, the [IFC Forum](https://community.infiniteflight.com/c/support/17) **must**{.red} be used. Preferential support is not provided to IFATC.



## General

### 1A.2.1    

Discord is a messenger app for teams to make work simpler, more pleasant and more productive. More information on how this app works can be found [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us).

 

### 1A.2.2

 The channels and their use is outlined in the table below:

## Voice Channels

### 1A.2.4

The use of Voice Channels (VC's) **must**{.red} only be used in accordance with the Discord and Discord Voice Channel rules *(see [1A.2.1](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-new-entrants/1a.2-general-rules#1a.2.1) below)*. Controllers who are operating an airport independently without assistance **should not**{.red} claim a VC unless:

- the control positions are split (e.g. passing Ground control to another member whilst still operating Tower)
- a Radar Controller opens at the airport
- and/or all facility Controllers opt to communicate via a VC in *#controllers*



The use of VC's is **not required**{.red} and is at the sole discretion of the IFATC member (there may be select events where the use of VC's is required to guarantee operational efficiency - if this is the case, Controllers that do not wish to use voice may have to control elsewhere).

Controllers who wish to observe others in a VC for educational purposes may **ONLY**{.red} do so if **ALL**{.red} operational Controllers in the VC have given consent. Observers **must not**{.red} distract from the active ATC operation and **should**{.red} remain muted.



Below are some useful tips for VC's:

- You can see how many members currently occupy a VC at any time by noting the [00/08] channel count!
- Selecting "Mute" means no one can hear you
- Selecting "Deafen" means you don't hear anyone else
- Always double check your sound settings (i.e. Input = Mic and Output = Speaker)
- Connecting to a VC will act much like a phone call and can run in the background while controlling
