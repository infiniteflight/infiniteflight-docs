# 1A.2  Discord Rules

 

Tip

: All Controllers **must**{.red} ensure that their Discord Nickname is either the same as their IFC Username or real name - this means that Controllers can be found easily if required *(see [1A.2.1](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.2-discord-rules#1a.2.1) below)*



## General

### 1A.2.1

- All Controllers **must**{.red} link their [Community Forum](/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/user-profile#linking-community-forum-account) and [Discord](/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/user-profile#linking-a-discord-account) accounts **BEFORE** controlling
- Controllers **must**{.red} ensure that their Discord Nickname is either the same as their IFC Username or real name
- Controllers **must not**{.red} share any IFATC material or conversations (including audio) contained within the IFATC Discord externally (unless prior approval has been granted)
- Controllers **must**{.red} be respectful to other users and practice common courtesies
- Controllers **must not**{.red} use any language which, in the exclusive discretion of Infinite Flight, may be deemed offensive (including, but not limited to, language that is unlawful, threatening, vulgar, sexually explicit, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable)
- Criticism and feedback will generally be given via DM; however, on occasion, it may be provided publicly if it is deemed to be a wider issue amongst Controllers



## Voice Channels

### 1A.2.2

- English **must**{.red} be used at all times
- The voice channels **must**{.red} only be used by members who are actively controlling with other Controllers
- Coordination to use voice channels **must**{.red} only occur in the *#controllers* Discord channel
- Controllers **must not**{.red} transmit anything that may be interpreted as disruptive
- Controllers **must not**{.red} transmit any private, identifying or sensitive information
- Controllers **must not**{.red} impersonate another user
- Further guidance on the use of VCs can be found in Discord Communication *(see [1A.1.4](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.1-discord-communication#1a.1.4) above)*



### 1A.2.3

Members may contact a Staff Member or IFC Moderator at any time to report a serious violation of VC rules or an unsafe situation. IFATC member safety and privacy is a top priority.

> Due to the nature of ATC and the representation of widely diverse social norms, there may be accidental utterances provoked by excitement which do not warrant moderation (e.g. mild profanity and spontaneous phrases as a result of a startling event)



## Support

### 1A.2.4

- In the first instance, Controllers **should**{.red} make every effort to use the resources available to them, including this manual and fellow Controllers, to seek support
- If Controllers are unable to find the answer they need, they can "raise" a ticket in the *#help-request* Discord Channel by "reacting" to the relevant role. A new private channel will be created which the Controller can then open to start a dialogue and get the support they need
- The Rank Structure can be helpful to find out what the different roles in IFATC are, and therefore who might be appropriate to ask *(see [1A.6.1](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.6-rank-structure#1a.6.1) below)*
