# 1A.5  Activity Requirements

 

### 1A.5.1    

Controllers **should**{.red} maintain some level of activity and proficiency. The following defines actions taken following periods of inactivity:

 

 -    30 Days:   Written reminder of activity requirements

 -    90 Days:   Removal from IFATC and Discord, **must**{.red} complete the Initial Practical test to re-join (minimum of 30 days **must**{.red} elapse from the date of removal before able to complete the test - Controllers that are removed from IFATC for inactivity more than twice, are not permitted to rejoin - *see [1A.5.2](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.5-activity-requirements#1a.5.2) below*)

 -    12 Months:  **Must**{.red} complete the Initial Theory and Practical tests to re-join

 

> For the purposes of activity, the ATIS frequency is not included, and therefore Controllers **must**{.red} control Ground, Tower and/or Radar positions to be considered active



### 1A.5.2

Controllers that are removed twice for inactivity will not be permitted to rejoin due to the strain this has on recruitment and training resources. This can be appealed with the IFATC Manager or IFATC Moderators and will be handled on a case by case basis.



### 1A.5.3    

Minimum and maximum controlling times are enforced to ensure that pilots receive a good and consistent service. These are highlighted in the table below: 

 

| Rank        | Minimum Time | Maximum Time |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Apprentice  | 30 minutes   | 12 hours     |
| Specialist* | 1 hour       | 12 hours     |
| Officer*    | 1 hour       | 12 hours     |
| Supervisor  | 1 hour       | 12 hours     |

**This includes Controllers currently in the Specialist/Officer Check Ride phase (see [1A.7.1](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.7-check-ride-process#1a.7.1) below)*



> Controllers **must**{.red} ensure that the standard of controlling expected is maintained during long sessions, the maximum controlling times are cumulative and **must not**{.red} be exceeded in a 24 hour period



### 1A.5.4   

Before opening a frequency, Controllers **must**{.red} ensure that they not only have the minimum time free but also have:

 

 -    An adequate amount of battery life on the device to be used

 -    A good/reliable internet connection
