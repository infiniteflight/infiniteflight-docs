# 1A.6  Rank Structure

 

Tip

: When you are promoted you will have access to airports that typically have more traffic. It is encouraged that you start off slowly, gradually building up to these more "high-volume" traffic airports within your new classification. This is particularly important during peak times or official events. If in doubt, ask in *#controllers* for suggestions before opening â€“ it takes time to get used to heavy traffic, start off **SLOWLY**

 

### 1A.6.1    

The table below outlines the rank structure in place. Promotion is based on activity, performance, feedback and in some cases, training and testing:

 

| Rank       | Frequencies Available    | Test Required                | Check Ride |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ---------- |
| Apprentice | B / C / D / ATIS         | Theory and Practical (Tower) | No         |
| Specialist | B / C / D / ATIS         | No                           | Yes*       |
| Officer    | Radar / B / C / D / ATIS | Theory and Practical (Radar) | Yes**      |
| Supervisor | No restrictions          | No                           | No         |

**On promotion to Specialist, Controllers are placed on probation until the "Specialist Check Ride" phase is completed (see [1A.7.4](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.7-check-ride-process#1a.7.4) below)*

***On promotion to Officer, Controllers are placed on probation until the "Officer Check Ride" phase is completed (see [1A.7.6](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.7-check-ride-process#1a.7.6) below)*



> All Controllers are subject to promotion/demotion at any time based on activity, performance and feedback!



## Apprentice

### 1A.6.2

This is the entry rank for IFATC and so the maximum arrival count at the time of opening any airport is 25 aircraft. Apprentices **must not**{.red} control any facility which is a livestream airport, official event airport, or HUB of published event featured on the ATC Schedule *(other official events are permitted unless indicated otherwise - see [1A.4.1](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.4-airport-selection#1a.4.1) above)*



> It is acceptable for the arrival count to increase above this limit once open, however Apprentices **should**{.red} try to select appropriate airports that take into account the length of time they are controlling for, and any increases in traffic *(see [1A.4.1](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.4-airport-selection#1a.4.1) and [1A.5.3](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.5-activity-requirements#1a.5.3) above)*



## Promotion to Specialist

### 1A.6.3

Promotion to the rank of Specialist is dealt with on a case by case basis, and not solely on time served. With this in mind, Apprentice Controllers **must**{.red} avoid asking when they will be promoted; and instead, **should**{.red} focus on providing a good quality ATC service. Controllers will be notified when they have been promoted and placed in the Specialist Check Ride phase *(see [1A.7.4](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.7-check-ride-process#1a.7.4) below)*.



## Promotion to Officer

### 1A.6.4

Promotion to the rank of Officer is by application only *(see [7.4.1](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.4-radar-written-and-practical-tests#7.4.1) below)* and the Radar Training program **must**{.red} be successfully passed in order to achieve this rank and subsequently control radar facilities. 



### 1A.6.5

Before commencement of training for the rank of Officer, the following requirements **must**{.red} be met:



- Minimum of 60 days at the rank of Specialist
- Minimum of 2000 all-time operations
- Attend a minimum of 10 training sessions per 30 days in the *#training* Discord channel (this is counted with the honor system and members are expected to track their own attendance)
- Maintain an active controlling record* over the previous 30 days to ensure proficiency (this will be determined by the Recruiter at the time of application)



**An active controlling record is considered to be 2-3 ATC sessions per week*



### 1A.6.6

Returning members of IFATC that previously held the rank of Officer are not subject to the above same criteria and may apply (and commence training) for the rank of Officer immediately following the successful completion of the "Specialist Check Ride" phase *(see [1A.7.1](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.7-check-ride-process#1a.7.1) below)*.



## Promotion to Supervisor 

### 1A.6.7

The rank of Supervisor is only awarded when a need exists and to Controllers that have demonstrated a high standard of controlling and professional conduct within IFATC. Their role is to assist in the day-to-day operations of IFATC, provide leadership and/or mentoring of individual Controllers, monitor controlling quality via the "Check Ride" process, and to moderate the Infinite Flight Expert Server. The following prerequisites are required for promotion to the rank of Supervisor:



- Officer rank with demonstrated proficiency on **all** facility types/classes
- Correct usage of the report feature with no history of misuse
- Proficient pilot who leads by example and aviates in accordance with all server rules
- Positive IFATC record
- Ability to communicate respectfully and professionally
