# 1A.7  Check Ride Process



### 1A.7.1

The Check Ride process is used to monitor newly promoted Specialists and Officers, the procedures to be followed are outlined below:



| Check Ride    | Period  | Max Arrival Count* | Eligibility                                                  |
| ------------- | ------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Specialist    | 7 days  | 50                 | See [1A.6.2](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.6-rank-structure#1a.6.2) above |
| Officer       | 30 days | 50                 | See [1A.6.3](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.6-rank-structure#1a.6.3) above |
| Prior Officer | 15 days | 50                 | See [1A.6.6](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.6-rank-structure#1a.6.6) above |

**at the time of opening* 

> One of the main aspects of the Check Ride process is ensuring that quality of service is maintained with the Controller's new role. Therefore during the evaluation, the Controller's ability to select sensible airports and set a personal limitation **must**{.red} be satisfactory to complete the Check Ride phase



### 1A.7.2

When Controllers are eligible for promotion to the rank of Specialist (based on activity, performance and feedback) or have passed The Radar Practical Test for the rank of Officer, they will receive a DM informing them of their promotion on a probationary basis. Moderators and/or Supervisors will receive automatic notifications when the Controller opens, and those that are available will attend the Controllerâ€™s current session and monitor their performance. At the end of the Check Ride phase, all evaluations will be collated, with a final review taking place. The Controller will be informed if they have been successful or unsuccessful, and given feedback when applicable.



### 1A.7.3

The Check Ride phase should not be longer than the periods outlined *(see [1A.7.1](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.7-check-ride-process#1a.7.1) above)*, however if Moderators and/or Supervisors are unable to attend one of the Controllers sessions during their probation period, their probation will be extended provided that they have followed **ALL** the instructions set out within this section and in particular, controlling on a regular basis in which to maximize the chance of a review. If this is not the case, they will be demoted back to their previous rank, and a subsequent promotion will take place in due course.

### 1A.7.4

Controllers that are currently in the Specialist Check Ride phase:

- **must**{.red} control Bravo classification airports where possible (Charlie classification airports are acceptable if they provide for adequate evaluation)
