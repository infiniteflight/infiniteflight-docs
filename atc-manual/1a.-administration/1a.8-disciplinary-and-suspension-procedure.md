# 1A.8  Disciplinary and Suspension Procedure

 

### 1A.8.1    

Controllers not following the ATC Manual can expect the following procedure:

 

| Offense | Action Taken                          |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1st     | Warning via DM                        |
| 2nd     | 3 day Controller & Discord suspension |
| 3rd     | 7 day Controller & Discord suspension |
| 4th     | Removal from the IFATC Team           |

Following any suspension, Controllers will return at the rank they previously held. Usually the date theyâ€™re reinstated on will serve as the new start date at that rank; however, this is dealt with on a case by case basis *(this is to take into account minimum requirements for rank upgrades - see [1A.6.1](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.6-rank-structure#1a.6.1) above)*. 



### 1A.8.2

If a controller is issued a Level 2 or Level 3 Violation whilst operating as a pilot, an IFATC Moderator will initiate a review of the session to determine if the Violation is to be upheld or removed. Excessive Violations or total lack of regard for rules may result in IFATC suspension or permanent removal.
