# 1A.2  General Rules

 

Tip

: All Controllers **must**{.red} ensure that their Discord Nickname is either the same as their IFC Username or real name - this means that Controllers can be found easily if required *(see [1A.2.1](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-new-entrants/1a.2-general-rules#1a.2.1) below)*



### 1A.2.1    

The following rules **must**{.red} be followed at all times:

 

|                      **Discord Rules**                       |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| All Controllers **must**{.red} [link](/guide/getting-started/home-user-interface/user-profile#linking-community-forum-account) their Community Forum Account **BEFORE**{.red} controlling |
| Controllers **must**{.red} ensure that their Discord Nickname is either the same as their IFC Username or real name |
| Controllers **must not**{.red} share any IFATC material or conversations (including audio) contained within the IFATC Discord externally (unless prior approval has been granted). |
| Controllers **must**{.red} be respectful to other users and practice common courtesies. |
| Controllers **must not**{.red} use any language which, in the exclusive discretion of Infinite Flight; may be deemed offensive (including, but not limited to, language that is unlawful, threatening, vulgar, sexually explicit, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable). |
| Criticism and feedback will generally be given via DM; however, on occasion, it may be provided publicly if it is deemed to be a wider issue amongst Controllers. |
| Off topic material, including memes and GIFs, **must not**{.red} be used outside of the *#offtopic* channel. |



|                    **Controlling Rules**                     |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| All Controllers **must**{.red} announce in *#controllers* when opening/closing any frequency on the Expert Server. When closing, a **MINIMUM**{.red} of 5 minutes warning and the last ATIS letter used **must**{.red} be provided. |
| Controllers **must**{.red} control within the bounds* of the ATC Schedule posted every week on the IFC and in *#readonly* on Discord. The only exception to this is when Controllers are not qualified to do so as per the rank structure *(see [1A.3.1](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-new-entrants/1a.3-rank-structure#1a.3.1) below)*, in which case a sensible alternative can be selected. |
| Unless otherwise specified in the ATC Schedule, the 'region change' occurs at 0600Z (Controllers that are open during a region change **must**{.red} still meet the minimum controlling times before closing - *see [1A.5.2](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-new-entrants/1a.5-activity-requirements#1a.5.2) below*). Controllers **must not**{.red} open airports in the new region before the region changeover time unless it is within an hour of changeover, there are no active frequencies open **AND**{.red} no traffic exists in the **CURRENT**{.red} region. In addition, Controllers are expected to show courtesy to other Controllers by sharing where possible, and opening the frequencies before announcing in *#controllers* - Controllers **must not**{.red} purposely wait for the region changeover time and then post that they are 'open' in *#controllers* in an attempt to be 'first'. |
| Opening frequencies is on a first come, first serve basis within *#controllers*. Therefore Controllers **should not**{.red} reserve frequencies privately or not open in anticipation of a particular frequency becoming available. This does not apply to certain events where frequency allocation may be authorized. |
| Controllers **must not**{.red} control on the Training Server *(see [7.5.4](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.5-radar-theory-and-practical-tests#7.5.4) below for exceptions).* |
| Controllers **must not**{.red} act as a Controller and as a pilot simultaneously on separate devices, violating Infinite Flight’s Terms & Agreement. |
| Standards of controlling are closely monitored – **Controllers are expected to control within their means,  prioritizing quality over quantity**{.red} *(see [1A.3](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-new-entrants/1a.3-rank-structure#1a.3-rank-structure) below)* |

*The "bounds of the ATC Schedule" is defined as the colored region that is highlighted for that day and/or time period. In addition, Controllers **should**{.red} prioritize the opening of featured airports first, however all airports within the region are available 



|               **Discord Voice Channel Rules**                |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|         English **must**{.red} be used at all times.         |
| The *#controlling[1-5]* voice channels **must**{.red} only be used by members who are actively controlling with other Controllers. |
| Coordination of the *#controlling[1-5]* voice channels **must**{.red} only occur in *#controllers*. |
| Controllers **must not**{.red} transmit anything that may be interpreted as disruptive. |
| Controllers **must not**{.red} transmit any private, identifying or sensitive information. |
|   Controllers **must not**{.red} impersonate another user.   |
| Further guidance on the use of Voice Channels can be found in Discord Communication Guidelines *(see [1A.1.6](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-new-entrants/1a.1-discord-communication-guidelines#1a.1.6) above)*. |




**Safeguarding:** Members may contact a Staff Member or Moderator at any time to report a serious violation of Voice Channel rules or an unsafe situation. IFATC member safety and privacy is a top priority.

*Note: Due to the nature of ATC and the representation of widely diverse social norms there may be accidental utterances provoked by excitement which do not warrant moderation (e.g. mild profanity and spontaneous phrases as a result of a startling event).*
