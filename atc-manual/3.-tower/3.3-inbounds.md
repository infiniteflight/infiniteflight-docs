# 3.3 Inbounds



Tip

: Local flights may be authorized if inbound at a position, altitude, and speed which does not disrupt the flow of traffic. Controllers **should**{.red} attempt to accommodate inbound traffic, regardless of flight time, but may deny services if an unreasonable request is made that will diminish service for other aircraft



## Pattern Entry, Sequence and Clearance



### 3.3.1

When there is no Radar Controller present, Tower **must**{.red} issue a pattern entry and clearance to **ALL** aircraft as a **MINIMUM**, regardless of what the aircraft uses to check in on the Tower frequency - the use of sequencing will be dependent on traffic *(see 3.3.1.1 below)*. In addition, Controllers may wish to take into account the aircraft flight plan (in particular the STAR) when issuing the pattern entry, however; traffic flow and common sense **should**{.red} also be considered (i.e. if the STAR leads an aircraft into a straight in, but due to traffic it would be better for the aircraft to enter downwind; then Controllers **should**{.red} be proactive in managing this).

### 3.3.2

If Controllers are unsure on which pattern entry to use (i.e. if the aircraft is still quite far away), then the use of "Continue Inbound" can be sent initially however, Controllers **must**{.red} update the inbound aircraft **BEFORE** reaching the pattern with a pattern entry *(see [3.3.1](/guide/atc-manual/3.-tower/3.3-inbounds#3.3.1) above)*. Similarly, if Controllers are unsure on an aircraft's sequence number, a pattern entry without sequence can be sent, but this **must**{.red} be updated when the Controller knows where to fit the aircraft in.



## Runway Changes



### 3.3.3

Controllers **should**{.red} try to accommodate aircraft requests for different runways, provided it does not compromise the level of service given to other aircraft.



### 3.3.4

If a runway change is issued, a new pattern entry and clearance **must**{.red} be given (the use of sequencing will be dependent on traffic).



## Cleared for the Option



### 3.3.5    

If an aircraft is in the pattern "Cleared for the Option" **must**{.red} be used as it gives the pilot the option of a landing / touch & go / stop & go or low approach.



### 3.3.6

If the aircraft has already been instructed to make left/right traffic from the initial take-off clearance or the previous landing clearance, then the use of "make left/right traffic" is no longer required to be used as it is assumed the pilot will continue with this pattern unless told otherwise. If the pilot is given a new pattern entry or new runway, when clearing for the option, you **must**{.red} tell the pilot whether to make left/right traffic.
