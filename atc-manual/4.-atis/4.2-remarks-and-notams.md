# 4.2 Remarks and NOTAMs

 

Tip

: Controllers **should**{.red} avoid adding too many REMARKS and NOTAMS into a single ATIS as this will dilute the message – Controllers **should**{.red} ask themselves what the most important messages are, and prioritise as required *(see [4.2.1](/guide/atc-manual/4.-atis/4.2-remarks-and-notams#4.2.1) below)*



### 4.2.1

The table below highlights when certain REMARKS or NOTAMS **should**{.red} be used:

 

| REMARK  / NOTAM       | When to be used?                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| No Intersection Dept. | Intersection departures **must**{.red} always be allowed unless it blocks the only taxiway for aircraft to access full length **AND** will affect the departure/arrival flow rate *(see [3.2.5](/guide/atc-manual/3.-tower/3.2-departures#3.2.5) above)* |
| No Pattern Work       | Weather below VMC? Terrain prevents a standard pattern from being flown? **CURRENT** traffic levels will cause a drop in service standards? When 1 of these conditions is met, No Pattern Work **must**{.red} be used *(see [3.4.1](/guide/atc-manual/3.-tower/3.4-pattern-work-transitions-flight-of-xx#3.4.1) above)* |
| Gate Hold             | The use of hold position *(see [2.1.3](/guide/atc-manual/2.-ground/2.1-runway-selection-and-pushback#2.1.3) above)* **should**{.red} be favored but if a long line of  departures needs to be cleared and you have limited space on the taxiways,  gate hold can be used (it **should**{.red} be limited to a maximum of 10 minutes) |
| No Light Aircraft     | This command **must not**{.red} be used at GA focused airports but can be used at the Controller's discretion at any other airport based on airport accommodations (such as GA parking and airport layout), current traffic, and airport staffing. Controllers **should**{.red} make every attempt to accept light* aircraft at airports which accept them IRL |
| Rolling Dept.         | To expedite departures – when aircraft are cleared for take-off they will be expected to line up and start their take-off roll immediately. The LUAW command can still be used when there is an operational advantage such as an arrival / departure sequence, or departure / departure sequence where the first aircraft is slow to begin their take-off roll |
| FPL Required          | Only to be used when weather is below VMC minima *(see [3.4.1](/guide/atc-manual/3.-tower/3.4-pattern-work-transitions-flight-of-xx#3.4.1) above)* or when SID/STAR usage is mandated |
| Straight Out Dept. ** | Runway heading **must**{.red} be flown after departure until no conflict exists **AND** the altitude specified by the Tower Controller has been met or exceeded *(see [3.2.8](/guide/atc-manual/3.-tower/3.2-departures#3.2.8) above)* |
| Mult. Freq. In Use    | *(See [4.1.5](/guide/atc-manual/4.-atis/4.1-overview#4.1.5) above)* |
| Check Forum           | Only to be used when referring pilots to special instructions on the IFC pages e.g. VARB Summit |
| SID/STAR Use Rcmd***  | This command **should**{.red} be used when light to moderate traffic exists and SID/STAR use is not essential for traffic management *(see [4.2.2](/guide/atc-manual/4.-atis/4.2-remarks-and-notams#4.2.2) below)* |
| SID/STAR Use Req***   | This command **should**{.red} be used when heavy traffic exists and SID/STAR use is essential for traffic management **OR** for events and/or main hub airports  *(see [4.2.2](/guide/atc-manual/4.-atis/4.2-remarks-and-notams#4.2.2) below)* |
| Event                 | IF LLC sponsored events only                                 |
| Size Restrictions     | When any aircraft cannot be accommodated because their size will restrict airport flow (i.e. block taxiways or ramp areas), this command **must**{.red} be used *(see [2.1.1](/guide/atc-manual/2.-ground/2.1-runway-selection-and-pushback#2.1.1) above)* |
| Low Visibility        | Low Visibility – visibility less than ¼  statute miles (400m) |

 

**For the purposes of IF, "light" aircraft are defined as the C172, SR22, XCub, Spitfire Mk VIII and P38*

***Take note that the use of "Straight Out Dept." may prevent aircraft from flying their selected SID (see [3.2.8](/guide/atc-manual/3.-tower/3.2-departures#3.2.8) above)*

****Only to be used if the airport has published SID/STAR procedures available*



### 4.2.2

Controllers can select the preferred SIDs/STARs for the airport and **should**{.red} include a reasonable variety of authorized procedures to allow for departures/arrivals from **ALL** directions. By convention, this **should**{.red} be decided by Radar Controllers (in their absence, the Tower Controller may choose but this is not encouraged).
