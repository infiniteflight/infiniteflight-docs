# 6.1  What is a Radar Controller?

 

Tip

: It is encouraged that new Radar Controllers start off slowly, gradually building up to the more "high-volume" traffic airports. This is particularly important during peak times or events such as Friday Night Flight (FNF)

 

### 6.1.1   

Although the radar position and its responsibilities are vast, fundamentally, there are three main objectives. These are:

 

 -    Providing aircraft & terrain separation

 -    Reducing Tower Controller workload

 -    Providing an expeditious departure, en-route and/or arrival service



### 6.1.2

Operating a radar frequency typically comes with a higher workload which is why extensive training is carried out before Controllers are granted the privilege *(see [7.5](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.5-radar-theory-and-practical-tests#7.5-radar-theory-and-practical-tests) below)*. Controlling aircraft from different directions in altitude, heading & speed, ensuring separation rules are adhered to, whilst still providing an expeditious service are some of the reasons that contribute to this *(see 6.1.2.1 below).*

**BEFORE**{.red} opening, Controllers **must** ensure that they have a plan to manage the expected workload.
