# 6.5  Flight Following



### 6.5.1    

Flight Following is a VFR service that can be requested by a pilot with or without a Flight Plan, therefore Controllers can expect pilots to 'see and avoid'. Radar Controllers can acknowledge this request and if the pilot has a flight plan, they will be expected to continue following it. 



### 6.5.2    

Pilots are however, still subject to vectors and altitude assignments as dictated by traffic, Radar Controllers **must**{.red} make this judgment to ensure separation is maintained with the other aircraft in their airspace.



### 6.5.3    

If you do issue a vector and/or altitude assignment, once the risk of conflict is no longer present, you **should**{.red} let the pilot know by sending "Continue as Filed" and/or "Altitude at your Discretion" respectively (*see [6.5.5](/guide/atc-manual/6.-radar/6.5-flight-following#6.5.5) below for exceptions)*. "Resume Own Navigation" **should**{.red} be used instead of "Continue as Filed"  if the aircraft is no longer expected to return to their flight plan or does not have a flight plan filed. 



### 6.5.4    

A frequency change **should**{.red} be issued when the aircraft is departing your airspace **AND**{.red} will no longer affect any other aircraft that is under your control.



### 6.5.5    

If an aircraft is inbound to the airport that you are controlling, you can ‘upgrade’ the level of service they have requested (e.g. "Expect Vectors for...") if the traffic does not allow for them to continue as VFR traffic. The "expect deviation from your flight plan" command is available if controllers need it.
