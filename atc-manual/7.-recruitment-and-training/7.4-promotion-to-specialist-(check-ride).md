# 7.4  Promotion to Specialist (Check Ride)

 

### 7.4.1    

When Controllers are eligible for promotion to the rank of Specialist (based on activity, performance and feedback), they will receive a DM informing them of their promotion on a probationary basis.



### 7.4.2    

The probation period **should not**{.red} exceed 7 days, unless it is due to Moderator/Supervisor availability *(see [7.4.4](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.4-promotion-to-specialist-(check-ride)#7.4.4) below*). During this time, Controllers:

 -    **Must**{.red} control Bravo classification airports where possible (Charlie classification airports are acceptable if they provide for adequate evaluation)
 -    **Must**{.red} control on a regular basis (at least 3 separate occasions)
 -    **Must not**{.red} control FNF (Friday Night Flight) hubs, FF (Flash Flight) or Twitch stream featured airports 



### 7.4.3    

Moderators and/or Supervisors will receive automatic notifications when the Controller opens, and those that are available will attend the Controller’s current session and monitor their performance. At the end of the Check Ride phase, all evaluations will be collated, with a final review taking place. The Controller will be informed if they have been successful or unsuccessful, and given feedback in all cases.



### 7.4.4    

If Moderators and/or Supervisors are unable to attend one of the Controllers sessions during their probation period, their probation will be extended provided that they have followed **ALL** the instructions set out within this section *(see [7.4.2](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.4-promotion-to-specialist-(check-ride)#7.4.2) above)* and in particular, controlling on a regular basis in which to maximize the chance of a review. If this is not the case, they will be demoted back to Apprentice, and a subsequent promotion will take place in due course.



### 7.4.5    

If the Controller has been successful, the probation period will end with immediate effect and the instructions contained within this section will no longer need to be followed. If they are unsuccessful, a waiting period will be given before they re-enter the Check Ride phase; in which time, the Controller will be able to improve in the areas briefed.



### 7.4.6    

Eligibility for promotion is dealt with on a case by case basis, and not solely on time served. With this is mind, Apprentice Controllers **must**{.red} avoid asking when they will be promoted; and instead, **should**{.red} focus on providing a good quality ATC service.
