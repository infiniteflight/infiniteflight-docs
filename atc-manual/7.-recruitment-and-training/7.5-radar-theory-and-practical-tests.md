# 7.5 Radar Theory and Practical Tests



> Controllers **must**{.red} ensure that they have an adequate amount of battery life on their device and a good/reliable internet connection



### 7.5.1    

The minimum requirements for becoming an Officer and subsequently controlling radar facilities is outlined within the rank structure *(see [1A.6.2](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.6-rank-structure#1a.6.2) above).* Controllers that wish to upgrade **must**{.red} contact a Recruiter (Controllers **must**{.red} ensure they meet the minimum requirements **BEFORE APPLYING**); in addition, they **must**{.red} have demonstrated a high level of competency in the following areas:

 

 -    Knowledge of this manual in its entirety, complying fully where instructed (i.e. use of **must**{.red}/**must not**{.red})

 -    Able to manage a high level of traffic on both Ground and Tower frequencies, simultaneously

 -    Controlling at large Bravo or "hub" airports

 -    Controlling during busy periods such as FNF, weekends and flashflights

 

### 7.5.2    

All training is considered optional with the exception of Radar Training – Controllers that wish to upgrade to Radar **must**{.red} have training, and meet the standards required *(see [7.5.4](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.5-radar-theory-and-practical-tests#7.5.4) below)* **BEFORE** The Radar Practical Test.



### 7.5.3

The Recruiter will conduct a review on the performance of the Controller that has requested Radar Training, Supervisors may be polled if further details are required. The requirements laid out within this section *(see [7.5.1](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.5-radar-theory-and-practical-tests#7.5.1) above)* will assist the Recruiter (and Supervisors if required) in gauging the Controller’s competency and suitability for the role. If the review is deemed successful, the Controller will be placed in the "Training Pool" ready for Trainer allocation. If the Controller is considered not to be ready, a set waiting period (minimum of 30 days) will be assigned where the Controller **must**{.red} endeavor to address the feedback given. Subsequent reviews will continue until there is no doubt that they are ready for the position.



### 7.5.4    

Following a successful review, a Trainer will be assigned who will contact the Controller and commence Radar Training (training for the position of Radar is mandatory). At an appropriate point during training, as decided by the Trainer; a Recruiter will issue the The Radar Theory Test (and debrief as appropriate on the result) **BEFORE** commencement of The Radar Practical Test. The Radar Practical Test will be organized at the Trainer’s discretion however a Recruiter will be required for the official test *(see [7.1.1](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.1-overview#7.1.1) above).* Controlling on the Training Server is only authorized for Controllers that have met the requirements for upgrade to the rank of Officer *(see [1A.6.2](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.6-rank-structure#1a.6.2) above)*, and have **STARTED** their Radar Training with a Trainer.



### 7.5.5    

Whilst under Training, Controllers may wish to seek fellow Controllers to fly radar patterns on the IFATC Server for extra practice if the Trainer is not available. Provided the Controller has the Trainer’s permission, the use of the Discord *#training-time[1-3]* channels is authorized to try and find Controllers that are free (Controllers **must**{.red} only use a channel that is currently not in use for a training session).



### 7.5.6    

All aircraft present at The Radar Practical Test **must**{.red} fly in accordance with the radar service being provided; in addition, any aircraft type can be selected but it **must**{.red} be deemed suitable to meet the training objective. The following table lists the items that are included in the Radar Practical test:

 

| Test Element                   | Proficiency Required*                                        |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Terrain  Separation**{.red}  | Ensures that a minimum of 1000ft clearance is maintained with terrain at all times |
| **Aircraft  Separation**{.red} | Ensures that a minimum of 3nm separation laterally or 1000ft separation vertically is maintained at all times |
| Time  Management               | Consistently provides an expeditious approach to all aircraft under radar control, minimal vectoring to get aircraft in the  correct area for an approach and combined commands (altitude and heading)  where appropriate |
| Approach Type                  | Able to deliver all types of service as outlined within this manual, and in particular, consistent timing and the correct technique (below the G/S) for the intercept heading of the ILS/GPS Approach |
| Go-Around                      | Correct use of missed-approach command and subsequent vectoring. Proactive monitoring and use of go-around if aircraft  set up incorrectly for the type of approach they are flying |

**Automatic Failure: if proficiency is not met for elements marked in red, the test is automatically failed.**{.red} 

**The recruiter has the final say on the result of the test (see [7.1.1](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.1-overview#7.1.1) above)*

 

### 7.5.7    

Controllers that are successful in The Radar Practical Test will be promoted and placed in the Officer Check Ride phase for a period of 30 days. Moderators and/or Supervisors will receive automatic notifications when the Controller opens, and those that are available will attend the Controller’s current session and monitor their performance. At the end of the Officer Check Ride phase, all evaluations will be collated, with a final review taking place. The Controller will be informed if they have been successful or unsuccessful, and given feedback in all cases. **During this time, Controllers are expected to be responsible in their new role; starting off slowly and ensuring quality of service, over quantity.**{.red}
