# 7A.1 Overview



### 7A.1.1

The Training Team (Trainers) is here to educate and train individuals within their specific area of study as Air Traffic Controllers, ensuring test readiness and a high standard of controlling.



### 7A.1.2

Trainers **must**{.red} ensure that all requirements are met before taking on a Trainee. In an instance where there is ambiguity, this manual overrides any conflicting information. Trainers unsure as to the circumstances of a Trainee (or possible exemptions to the prescribed guidelines) **must**{.red} consult a Recruiter for a final verdict. 



### 7A.1.3	

Members of the Training Team are selected on a merit-only basis with regards to past service and current skill levels as a Controller. Merit is based on, but not limited to:



- community service

- good behavior

- comprehensive understanding of this manual

- and other considerations as appropriate at the time of choosing

  

Any Controller considered **must**{.red} hold the rank of Officer as a minimum in order to qualify (this is to guarantee that all components of the training program can be taught).



### 7A.1.4

When new Trainers are added, they are subject to a 30 day probationary period during which time the Trainer **must not**{.red} take more than 3 trainees at any given time (this is to allow Trainers to decide whether or not the role is for them and to avoid staffing issues if there is a lapse in coverage).



### 7A.1.5

As representatives of the Training Team, Trainers **must**{.red} conduct themselves in a professional manner, reflective of the team and service they provide on a daily basis. Trainers may be demoted or removed from the Training Team if expectations are not met. 



### 7A.1.6

When new Trainers are selected, they will be added to the following channels within Discord:



| Channel        | Purpose                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| #leadership-hq | This channel will be used as a read only announcement channel for all leadership roles. Conversation prompts will be hosted in threads, when needed |
| #tests         | Recruiters will post in this channel with assignments and communication for a test |
| #tester [VC]   | This can be used for test participants as a general lounge or operationally to coordinate during an active test. All feedback **should**{.red} still given in writing via the test topic |
| #test-time     | Automatic notifications of upcoming tests will appear in this channel. Testers **must**{.red} "react" to the post to confirm attendance. Further communication for a test will be in the specific thread for that test in the *#tests* Discord channel |
| #trainers      | Main channel for coordination purposes within the Training Team |
| #training      | Trainers will use this channel to create a topic for each scheduled training session. This is where training session objectives, assignments, and feedback will be given |
| #training-time | Trainers will post in this channel when they require pilots to join in for a training session. Pilots available for the session can "react" to the post to indicate attendance. If all available slots are already filled, Pilots **must not**{.red} "react" to the request |
| #training [VC] | This can be used for participants as a general lounge or operationally to coordinate during an active training session. All feedback **should**{.red} still given in writing via the training topic |



> All test session coordination **must**{.red} take place in the designated channel as directed by the Recruiter



### 7A.1.7

The use of VCs for coordination between Trainers and their Trainees **must**{.red} be conducted in accordance with Section 1A - Administration *(see [1A.1.4](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.1-discord-communication#1a.1.4) and [1A.2.2](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.2-discord-rules#1a.2.2) above)*. Itâ€™s intended use is for one-on-one training through the session but may also be used to brief/debrief before or after a session, or for general Trainer/Trainee meetings. It is entirely voluntary and at the discretion of the Trainer and Trainee.
