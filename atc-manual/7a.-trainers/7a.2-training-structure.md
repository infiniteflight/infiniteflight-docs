# 7A.2 Training Structure 



### 7A.2.1

Candidates/Controllers **must**{.red} ensure that all requirements are met before requesting training. These requirements and the full process are outlined in the following locations:

 

| Trainee Type | Location                                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Candidate    | [ATC Training Post](https://community.infiniteflight.com/t/atc-training/416531) on the IFC Forum |
| Controller   | See [7.4](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.4-radar-theory-and-practical-tests#7.4-radar-theory-and-practical-tests) above |



### 7A.2.2

All Trainers **must**{.red} proactively monitor the website for [training requests](https://if-atc.com/atc/waitlist). Trainees **should**{.red} be claimed within a 7 day timeframe by accepting the request *(see [7A.3.1](/guide/atc-manual/7a.-trainers/7a.3-trainer-admin#7a.3.1) below).*



### 7A.2.3

Once a Trainer has accepted a training request *(see [7A.3.1](/guide/atc-manual/7a.-trainers/7a.3-trainer-admin#7a.3.1) below)*, the Trainer **must**{.red} message the Trainee to begin dialogue and to organize training sessions. All sessions **must**{.red} be added to the [Training Schedule](https://if-atc.com/atc/schedule) on the website. Each session is broken down into half hour blocks every day on a weekly basis, allowing for multiple Trainers and Trainees to coordinate their own sessions. Training **must not**{.red} be conducted between 1700Z and 2359Z on Fridays unless prior authorization has been given due to limited availability of the trainer and/or trainee.



### 7A.2.4

A first-come, first-served basis is utilized for slots in the Training Schedule. Equal priority is shared with respect to the time(s) booked by those who need them (not applicable to testing).	



### 7A.2.5

Trainers **should**{.red} utilize the "Request Pilots On Discord" website function 30 - 60 minutes before a scheduled training session *(see [7A.3.3](/guide/atc-manual/7a.-trainers/7a.3-trainer-admin#7a.3.3) below)* which will send a notification to the *#training-time* Discord channel for pilots. Once the specific training channel to be used for that session is established, all subsequent coordination **should**{.red} only be in that channel.



### 7A.2.6

Trainers reserve the right to terminate training at any point *(see [7.1.4](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.1-overview#7.1.4) above and [7A.3.6](/guide/atc-manual/7a.-trainers/7a.3-trainer-admin#7a.3.6) below)*, but **should**{.red} speak to the Trainee's Recruiter **BEFORE** termination as this may effect the Trainee's eligibility for joining IFATC (or future promotions if already within IFATC). A two strike policy is normally observed allowing the Trainee the benefit of the doubt when mistakes are made however appeals may be reviewed by the Training Team Administrator and/or the IFATC Manager on a case-by-case basis. 



Reasons for termination can include (but are not limited to):



- failure to respond or communicate with their assigned Trainer(s)
- failure to attend scheduled training sessions
- not receptive to feedback and/or a bad attitude



### 7A.2.7

For Initial Training, Trainers **should**{.red} conduct training at airports with parallel and/or intersecting runways depending on the circumstances of their Trainees. The following list outlines recommended airports for Radar Training (Trainers are encouraged to rotate through each site on a consistent basis). Trainers **must not**{.red} train (or allow training to take place) at test sites in order to avoid any unfair advantages *(see [7B.2.1](/guide/atc-manual/7b.-testers/7b.2-initial-testing#7b.2.1) and [7B.3.2](/guide/atc-manual/7b.-testers/7b.3-radar-testing#7b.3.2) below)*:



+++ Beginner Airports

**Location: KSBP (elevation 212ft)**

| RWY  | Approach Type |
| ---- | ------------- |
| 07   | GPS           |
| 11   | ILS           |
| 25   | GPS           |
| 29   | GPS           |

> Minimal terrain in the vicinity of the airport (high terrain to the East but no factor). Single ILS Runway configuration



**Location: LPPT (elevation 374ft)**

| RWY  | Approach Type |
| ---- | ------------- |
| 03   | ILS           |
| 17   | GPS           |
| 21   | ILS           |
| 35   | GPS           |

> Minimal terrain in the vicinity of the airport. Provides good training for single runway and standard ILS operations as well as an introduction into intersecting runway operations



**Location: NZAA (elevation 23ft)**

| RWY  | Approach Type |
| ---- | ------------- |
| 05R  | ILS           |
| 23L  | ILS           |

> Minimal terrain in the vicinity of the airport. Single ILS runway configuration, use of runway 23L recommended. Provides good training for an introduction into STAR management

+++



+++ Intermediate Airports

**Location: PHOG (elevation 53ft)**

| RWY  | Approach Type |
| ---- | ------------- |
| 02   | ILS           |
| 05   | GPS           |
| 20   | GPS           |
| 23   | GPS           |

> High Terrain to the East and West of the airport. For RWY05 visual approaches it is recommended to bring traffic onto right downwind for RWY02 and feed in between RWY02 arrivals, or bring them directly onto a left downwind for RWY05. Trainee awareness on when to turn aircraft onto base/final to maintain terrain separation essential



**Location: SKRG (elevation 7027ft)**

| RWY  | Approach Type |
| ---- | ------------- |
| 01   | ILS           |
| 19   | GPS           |

Recommended STARs: KORB1A (North), OPME1A (Northwest), and MATR3A (South)

> High terrain on left/right downwind for RWY01. Provides good training for introduction to terrain awareness, high elevation airports and STAR management



+++ Advanced Airports

**Location: LFMN (elevation 12ft)**

| RWY  | Approach Type               |
| ---- | --------------------------- |
| 04L  | ILS                         |

| 22L  | GPS (recommend Visual only) |
| 22R  | GPS (recommend Visual only) |

Recommended STARs:  PERU6R (North-west), ABDI6R (West), and ABLA6R (West)

> High terrain to the North, North-east and West of the airport. Staggered approach technique recommended due to close proximity of parallel runways. Southwesterly runway configuration can be used for advanced visual approach training



**Location: MMMX (elevation 7316ft)**

| RWY  | Approach Type |
| ---- | ------------- |
| 05L  | GPS           |
| 05R  | ILS           |
| 23L  | ILS           |
| 23R  | GPS           |

Recommended STARs: AVSA1C (North), and TIKE1C (North-west)

> High terrain surrounds the airport. Short 6 mile final approach for RWY05R recommended, use left downwind and turn aircraft at San Mateo (SMO) VOR. Provides good training for aircraft speed management and high altitude airports



**Location: OAKB (elevation 5876ft)**

| RWY  | Approach Type |
| ---- | ------------- |
| 11   | GPS           |
| 29   | ILS           |

> High terrain on left/right downwind as well as multiple high-peaks throughout the region. Terrain awareness essential and provides good training opportunity for pre-session planning
