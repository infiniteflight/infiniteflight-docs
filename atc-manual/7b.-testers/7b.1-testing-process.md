# 7B.1 Testing Process



### 7B.1.1

All tests (regardless of position) are conducted by Recruiters and issued based on the given materials and/or scenarios provided in this section. Testing scenarios will vary from one recruit to the next. This is to ensure that Candidates/Controllers are better prepared for a wide array of situations found in the Expert Server environment. Care should be taken by the Recruiter(s) to avoid issuing the same testing scenario repeatedly. 



### 7B.1.2

When new Testers are selected, they will be added to the following channels within Discord:



| Channel       | Purpose                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| #testers      | Recruiters will post in this channel when they require pilots to join in for a Practical Test (Initial or Radar), including which testers channel the session will take place in. |
| #testers[1-3] | All test session coordination to take place in the designated channel as directed by the Recruiter (no more than one test per channel **must**{.red} be used at any one time). |



### 7B.1.3

It is the responsibility of all Recruiter(s), Trainer(s), and Tester(s) to maintain familiarity with this section and follow all procedures accordingly. All instructions provided by the Recruiter(s) **must**{.red} be followed in order to ensure a test is carried out in a fair manner. Any behavior not falling in line with the expectations of being a participant of the Testing Team are grounds for review and appropriate disciplinary measures as deemed by the IFATC Manager and/or the IFATC Moderator(s).



### 7B.1.4

The following table outlines the minimum notice period that **must**{.red} be given to a Candidate/Controller before their Initial or Radar Practical Test (including the test location):



| Test Type | Minimum Notice Period |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| Initial   | No minimum            |
| Radar     | 24 hours*             |

*The notice period may be reduced if the Recruiter and Candidate/Controller find a mutually acceptable time.
