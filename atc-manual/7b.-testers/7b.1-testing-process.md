# 7B.1 Testing Process



> All Testers **must**{.red} ensure that "in-progress airports" are hidden to ensure that taxiway networks are the same for both Testers and Recruits, thus avoiding confusion (Settings > Hide in-progress airports)



### 7B.1.1

All tests (regardless of position) are conducted by Recruiters and issued based on the given materials and/or scenarios provided in this section. Testing scenarios will vary from one recruit to the next. This is to ensure that Recruits are better prepared for a wide array of situations found in the Expert Server environment. Care should be taken by the Recruiter(s) to avoid issuing the same testing scenario repeatedly. Only those involved in the test **should**{.red} attend (unless previously authorized for a specific purpose) - an audience is not authorized. 



### 7B.1.2

When new Testers are selected, they will be added to the following channels within Discord:



| Channel        | Purpose                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| #leadership-hq | This channel will be used as a read only announcement channel for all leadership roles. Conversation prompts will be hosted in threads, when needed |
| #tests         | Recruiters will post in this channel with assignments and communication for a test |
| #tester [VC]   | This can be used for test participants as a general lounge or operationally to coordinate during an active test. All feedback **should**{.red} still given in writing via the test topic |
| #test-time     | Automatic notifications of upcoming tests will appear in this channel. Testers **must**{.red} "react" to the post to confirm attendance. Further communication for a test will be in the specific thread for that test in the *#tests* Discord channel |



> All test session coordination **must**{.red} take place in the designated thread as directed by the Recruiter



### 7B.1.3

It is the responsibility of all Recruiter(s), Trainer(s), and Tester(s) to maintain familiarity with this section and follow all procedures accordingly. All instructions provided by the Recruiter(s) **must**{.red} be followed in order to ensure a test is carried out in a fair manner. Any behavior not falling in line with the expectations of being a participant of the Testing Team are grounds for review and appropriate disciplinary measures as deemed by the IFATC Manager and/or the IFATC Moderator(s).



### 7B.1.4

The following table outlines the minimum notice period that **must**{.red} be given to a Recruit before their Tower or Radar Practical Test (including the test location):



| Test Type | Minimum Notice Period |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| Tower     | No minimum            |
| Radar     | 24 hours*             |

**The notice period may be reduced if the Recruiter and Recruit find a mutually acceptable time*
