# 7B.3 Radar Testing



> Trainers **must not**{.red} train (or allow training to take place) at test sites in order to avoid any unfair advantages *(see [7A.2.8](/guide/atc-manual/7a.-trainers/7a.2-training-structure#7a.2.8) above)*



### 7B.3.1

A standard radar test **must**{.red} consist of no more than 8 Testers flying in from locations assigned by the Recruiter. Attempts **should**{.red} be made to stagger aircraft departures from their respective locations in order to simulate the kind of traffic flow found on the Expert Server. Over the course of the test, the Trainee must be evaluated on the following material: 



- types of approaches
- terrain separation
- aircraft separation
- time management
- and go-arounds/missed approaches *(see [7.4.6](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.4-radar-written-and-practical-tests#7.4.6) above)*. 



Testers **must**{.red} carry out a number of listed maneuvers per instructions from the Recruiter:



- minimum of ONE departure from the test airport & request a radar pattern
- minimum of THREE inbounds with the purpose of a full stop
- minimum of ONE inbound with the intent to do one radar pattern after the first touch & go
- minimum of TWO pilots **must**{.red} have a STAR embedded in their FPLs for testing purposes (they **must**{.red} request approaches whilst inbound on those STARs and be handled accordingly)



Types of approaches will be assigned at the discretion of the Recruiter. No testing will be done on Center control, though any information on the handling of that position will come from both the training process and relevant supplementary material. 



### 7B.3.2

Only the pre-approved radar test sites **must**{.red} be used for the Radar Practical Test, this includes for re-test if an Officer has been demoted (i.e. from Officer to Specialist) or for returning members. See "Post Guidelines" in *#tests* Discord channel for locations.
