# 7C.1 Overview



### 7C.1.1

The Recruitment Team (Recruiters) have two main responsibilities, these are to manage new entrants during the recruitment process to join IFATC and secondly, to administer all theory and practical tests, with the final say on the result of the test (i.e. pass/fail).



### 7C.1.2

Recruiters are selected by the IFATC Manager based on a number of criteria, including, but not limited to:



- ATC theoretical knowledge & practical application


- time zone availability
- standing within IFATC
- and/or contributions to the IFATC team as a whole



Any Controller considered **must**{.red} hold the rank of Officer as a minimum in order to qualify (this is to guarantee that all components of the testing program can be administered).



### 7C.1.3 

The following table outlines the minimum notice period that **must**{.red} be given to a Recruit before their Tower or Radar Practical Test (including the test location):



| Test Type | Minimum Notice Period |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| Tower     | No minimum            |
| Radar     | 24 hours*             |

**The notice period may be reduced if the Recruiter and Recruit find a mutually acceptable time*



### 7C.1.4

To ensure test transparency (and provided resources allow), Recruiters **should not**{.red} administer the Tower or Radar Practical Test(s) for any Recruit that they have personally trained.



### 7C.1.5

When new Recruiters are selected, they will be added to the following channels within Discord:



| Channel        | Purpose                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| #leadership-hq | This channel will be used as a read only announcement channel for all leadership roles. Conversation prompts will be hosted in threads, when needed |
| #recruiters    | Main channel for coordination purposes within the Recruitment Team |
| #tests         | Recruiters will post in this channel with assignments and communication for a test |
| #tester [VC]   | This can be used for test participants as a general lounge or operationally to coordinate during an active test. All feedback **should**{.red} still given in writing via the test topic |
| #test-time     | Automatic notifications of upcoming tests will appear in this channel. Testers **must**{.red} "react" to the post to confirm attendance. Further communication for a test will be in the specific thread for that test in the *#tests* Discord channel |
| #trainers      | Main channel for coordination purposes within the Training Team |
| #training      | Trainers will use this channel to create a topic for each scheduled training session. This is where training session objectives, assignments, and feedback will be given |
| #training-time | Trainers will post in this channel when they require pilots to join in for a training session. Pilots available for the session can "react" to the post to indicate attendance. If all available slots are already filled, Pilots **must not**{.red} "react" to the request |
| #training [VC] | This can be used for participants as a general lounge or operationally to coordinate during an active training session. All feedback **should**{.red} still given in writing via the training topic |



> All test session coordination **must**{.red} take place in the designated thread as directed by the Recruiter



## Recruit User Notes and Activity Checks

### 7C.1.6

Recruiters **must**{.red} add user notes for any performance related issues during the recruitment process (including contact attempts and ban/termination). This ensures that there is an accurate summary displayed if the need arose for a review or there was an appeal on any decision made. In addition, Recruiters **should**{.red} do a comprehensive review of their list of Recruits at least once a month to check for activity. Both of these functions can be done by following the steps below:



Step 1

: Go to the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.infiniteflight.com) and login using your IFC credentials (if required, login is normally automatic)



Step 2

: From the navigation bar on the left of the screen, select "ATC Dashboard" under "IFATC"



Step 3

: Recruiters will be able to see a summary of their Recruits, and what stage they are each at



Step 4

: Select the purple arrow that is inline with the name of the Recruit that you would like to look at, this will open their "ATC" profile



Step 5

: The top navigation bar can then be used to navigate through the different tabs pertaining to that profile, and in particular, "User Notes" can be selected if a note is required



> Recruiters **must**{.red} ensure they use the "IFATC" label for notes that are related to recruitment



Tip

: Alternatively, you can select the "Recruits" tab from the navigation bar on the left of the screen and then search for the Recruit to access their profile



## Returning IFATC Members

### 7C.1.7

Returning members of IFATC **must**{.red} apply in the same manner as all Recruits, with the normal Profile Verification completed to ensure they are still eligible to join.

> Returning members of IFATC are not required to complete the Tower Written Test if they submit an application to join within 1 year of leaving IFATC, therefore Recruiters may need to utilize the "Skip to Training/Practical" buttons as appropriate



## Additional Permissions (Violations)



### 7C.1.8

Recruiters are granted the ability to issue Violations as a pilot whilst flying on the Infinite Flight Expert Server. Whilst moderating the server is a responsibility of Supervisors, it is recognised that Recruiters have the experience to also do this when they witness inappropriate behaviour.



### 7C.1.9

The following are examples of situations where it may be considered appropriate to exercise this ability:

- unmanned airports with no order
- clear violations of Expert Server rules
- environments where IFATC controllers are not enforcing instructions



### 7C.1.10

Violations **must**{.red} be issued for blatant offenses to the point where pilots on the Expert Server are being negatively affected by the actions of other pilots.		



Taxiing through other aircraft, landing on top of aircraft/failure to go around, going too fast in a controlled environment, and/or other clearly distinguishable acts of interference are some of the most common reasons to issue a Violation in the absence of a Controller. 



### 7C.1.11

Violations can be issued by following the process below:



Step 1

: Tap on the aircraft icon from your map/mini map



Step 2

: The pilot callsign/display name will appear, tap this to open the information tab



Step 3

: Tap the report button and select the reason most appropriate



### 7C.1.12

The pilot(s) have the ability to appeal their Violation via @appeals on the IFC within a 7 day span of time *(see [1B.3.1](/guide/atc-manual/1b.-violations/1b.3-incident-resolution-procedure#1b.3.1) above)*. It is strongly recommended that Recruiters have replays of their sessions on hand for that duration in order to deal with inquiries if required. Moderators, the Appeals Team and/or the IFATC Manager reserve the final say on the verdict of appeal(s).
