# 7D.1 Overview



### 7D.1.1

The purpose of the Supervisor Team is to assist in the day-to-day operations of IFATC, provide leadership and/or mentoring of individual Controllers, monitor controlling quality via the "Check Ride" process, and to moderate the Infinite Flight Expert Server.



To carry this out, Supervisors will be added to the following channel within Discord:

| Channel        | Purpose                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| #leadership-hq | This channel will be used as a read only announcement channel for all leadership roles. Conversation prompts will be hosted in threads, when needed |
| #supervisors   | This channel is used to facilitate communications between all Supervisors for any purpose deemed necessary |



### 7D.1.2

Supervisors are selected by the IFATC Manager based on a number of criteria, including, but not limited to:



- current standing within IFATC
- contributions to IFATC
- operational necessity
- and/or the ability to assist in internal team affairs within a professional context



> Supervisors may be demoted or removed from the Supervisor Team for any reason as deemed by the IFATC Manager (e.g. breach of trust, abuse of power, lack of commitment etc.)



### 7D.1.3

Supervisors **must**{.red} maintain proficiency by meeting the minimum activity requirements *(see [1A.5.1](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.5-activity-requirements#1a.5.1) above)*. Removal from IFATC due to inactivity, will also result in removal of the Supervisor role.
