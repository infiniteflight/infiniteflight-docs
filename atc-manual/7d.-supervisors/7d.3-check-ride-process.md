# 7D.3 Check Ride Process



### 7D.3.1

When a Controller enters the "Check Ride" phase *(see [7.4](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.4-promotion-to-specialist-(check-ride)#7.4-promotion-to-specialist-(check-ride)) above)*, an automatic message will be sent to the *#supervisors* Discord channel every time the Controller opens a frequency. As part of the "Check Ride" phase, Supervisors **should**{.red} make attempts to observe and/or fly for Controllers under review, this is to ensure that a certain quality and level of suitable improvement exists.



### 7D.3.2

Following attendance of a Controllers session the procedure below outlines how to submit feedback:



Step 1

: Access the *#supervisor* Discord channel and click the "HERE" link provided by the IFATC Website Bot for the Controller you wish to provide feedback for



Step 2

: This will take you to the "Sessions" tab of the Controller who is currently undergoing their Check Ride



Step 3

: Tap the green "Sessions" button which is located directly above "Session Date / Feedback", this will open a new session feedback form where details can be provided



### 7D.3.3

At the end of a Controller’s probationary period, the IFATC Manager will review the feedback conducted by Supervisors at "Check Ride" sessions *(see [7.4.5](/guide/atc-manual/7.-recruitment-and-training/7.4-promotion-to-specialist-(check-ride)#7.4.5) above)*. A decision will be made and repeated if necessary.
