# 7E.1 Overview



### 7E.1.1

The Infinite Flight Appeals Team objective is to review User-Appealed [Level 2 and 3 Violations](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/violations) issued by IFATC on the Expert Server. Appeals Team members **must**{.red} consider all factors and make an independent or team determination to uphold or reverse the issued Violation based on server rules, user history, and personal ATC experience. 



To carry this out, Appeals Team members will be added to the following channel within Discord:

| Channel  | Purpose                                                      |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| #appeals | This is where the appeals team can discuss appeals, procedures, and request additional input from Staff and IFC Moderators |



### 7E.1.2
