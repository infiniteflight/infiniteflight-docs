# 7E.1 Overview



### 7E.1.1

The Infinite Flight Appeals Team objective is to review User-Appealed [Level 2 and 3 Violations](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/violations) issued by IFATC on the Expert Server. Appeals Team members **must**{.red} consider all factors and make an independent or team determination to uphold or reverse the issued Violation based on server rules, user history, and personal ATC experience. 



To carry this out, Appeals Team members will be added to the following channel within Discord:

| Channel        | Purpose                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| #appeals       | This is where the appeals team can discuss appeals, procedures, and request additional input from Staff and IFC Moderators |
| #leadership-hq | This channel will be used as a read only announcement channel for all leadership roles. Conversation prompts will be hosted in threads, when needed |



### 7E.1.2

In rare circumstances a Level 1 Violation may be appealed and reviewed if it was the result of a technical issue outside of the User’s control *(see [7E.2.1](/guide/atc-manual/7e.-appeals/7e.2-appeals-process#7e.2.1) below)*



> User replays with session times totaling 50 hours or more **should**{.red} be ignored and the User advised to perform regular refreshes of the app. Extreme app use is discouraged and may result in technical errors which cannot be reproduced
