# 7E.2 Appeals Process



### 7E.2.1

The following Violations **should not**{.red} be reversed:

- Level 1 Violations as these are system generated (unless evidence provided can show the root cause is technical - *see [7E.1.2](/guide/atc-manual/7e.-appeals/7e.1-overview#7e.1.2) above*)
- Violations occurring whilst the User is away from their device
- Violations that are related to network/device issues



### 7E.2.2

Appeals **should**{.red} be handled on a first come, first served basis so that a resolution can be found as expeditiously as possible for the User. By convention, once an Appeals Team member is dealing with an Appeal, it is their responsibility to ensure that a resolution is found and the Appeal is closed. If however, another team member becomes available and notices an opportunity to expedite the process, then this is permitted but they **should**{.red} ensure that they communicate with the original team member assigned first to avoid confusing the situation.



### 7E.2.3

The following process outlines how appeals **must**{.red} be handled. If Appeals Team members feel that an exception is required, they may consult with Staff/IFC Moderators beforehand if they wish to do so:



Step 1

: A User will initiate a Level 2/3 Violation Appeal by making a public topic or by submitting a direct message addressed to the *@appeals* group, on the IFC *(see [7E.2.5](/guide/atc-manual/7e.-appeals/7e.2-appeals-process#7e.2.5) below)*



Step 2

: Assign yourself by scrolling to the bottom of the PM, tapping "Assign" (if using a mobile device, tap "Topic Controls" and then select "Assign" from the dropdown list)



Step 3

: Enter your IFC Username and tap "Assign" (if you do this in error, you can "Unassign" yourself using the same method)



Step 4

: If not provided already, request that the User provides all pertinent information which can be done using a number of canned responses *(see [7E.2.7](/guide/atc-manual/7e.-appeals/7e.2-appeals-process#7e.2.7) below)*



> When a request is made for more information, the User **must**{.red} be given 72 hours in which to reply. IFC Moderators may set a timer of 72 hours on the appeal if workload permits, if no reply is received the appeal will automatically close. Appeal Team members will still need to be proactive and request an IFC Moderator close the appeal if this is not done automatically



Step 5

: The minimum required information to successfully review a Violation is Callsign and/or User Identifier, Date/Time Received, Controller Name, Replay/Screenshots (when applicable), and Scenario Details - **Violations more than 7 days old are not eligible for appeal however, at the discretion of the Appeals Team, they can still be reviewed**{.red}



Tip

: As well as using the "Map and Messages" and "States" tabs when reviewing a replay, you can also find the User information by tapping on the aircraft from the map and selecting "Show Details for [callsign]"



Step 6

: The Appeal is then reviewed using all available tools, perspectives, and media provided in the Appeal request. A determination to uphold or reverse the Violation is made and the User is notified of the Appeal resolution (justified Violations may be reversed sparingly when it has no impact on others or the User has a profile in good standing)



+++ Decision - Violation Upheld

- Begin by thanking them for sending the replay
- Consider pointing out the reason the User was issued with a Violation. This will set the foundation for your decision
- Describe the events that led to the Violation being issued
- Follow up with any other issues that you may have recognized
- Conclude by informing them that you're rejecting the Appeal in a polite manner and to the maximum extent possible provide resources (i.e. User Guide, Video Tutorial, Community Topics and/or an explanation of correct procedure) to prevent a similar Violation being issued in the future

+++



+++ Decision - Violation Reversed

- Begin by thanking them for sending the replay
- If the replay shows the User followed instructions prior to the violation or if no other User was negatively impacted by their actions (and they have been polite/understanding about the situation), the Violation can be removed
- If ATC was at fault, apologize on behalf of the Controller for any inconvenience caused
- Remove the Violation from the dashboard with appropriate notes and inform the User to relaunch the Infinite Flight app for the reversal to take effect

> If it was a courtesy reversal, the Appeals Team member **must**{.red} communicate that this is a "one-time" offering

+++



> If the Violation is upheld and the User is a member of IFATC. The IFATC Manager or Admins **must**{.red} be informed so that further disciplinary action can be carried out *(see [1A.8.2](/guide/atc-manual/1a.-administration/1a.8-disciplinary-and-suspension-procedure#1a.8.2) above)*



### 7E.2.4

Following the completion of an Appeal, the Appeals Team member **must**{.red} "Archive" the Appeal by following the steps below:



Step 1

: Open the message on the [IFC](https://community.infiniteflight.com) *(same Steps 1 - 5 as [7E.2.7](/guide/atc-manual/7e.-appeals/7e.2-appeals-process#7e.2.7) below)*



Step 2

: "Unassign" yourself by scrolling to the bottom of the PM and tapping "Unassign" (if using a mobile device, tap "Topic Controls" and then select "Unassign" from the dropdown list)



Step 3

: Select "Archive" at the bottom of the PM



Step 4

: The message will be sent to the Appeals Archive where it can be accessed in the future if needed



> Appeals do not need to be "closed" ("archiving" **should**{.red} be sufficient) unless the User continues to message after a final decision on the Appeal has been made, it has been more than 72 hours with no response *(see [7E.2.3](/guide/atc-manual/7e.-appeals/7e.2-appeals-process#7e.2.3) above)* or the User is abusive in nature *(see [7E.3.2](/guide/atc-manual/7e.-appeals/7e.3-escalation-process#7e.3.2) below)*



### 7E.2.5

If when the *@appeals* team is added, the Controller that issued the Violation is already present and has given the reasons for the violation coherently (and you can see that these are justified), no input is required unless:

- the User has not accepted this decision and requested a review
- and/or the Controller has asked the appeals team to get involved

If the Controller was not in the topic/PM at the time of the Appeal, they **should not**{.red} be added unless it is deemed absolutely necessary. Anyone that is not involved with the Appeal **must**{.red} be removed by requesting an IFC Moderator to do so. If input from the Controller is required, the Appeals Team member **should**{.red} reach out privately and request this. 



> If you find that you are the Controller that issued the Violation, you **should**{.red} let another Appeals Team member deal with the appeal to promote transparency



### 7E.2.6

The following procedure outlines how to reverse a Violation:



Step 1

: Access the Appeals Administrator Dashboard (link is provided in the *#appeals* Discord channel)



Step 2

: Select "Users" from the navigation bar and then enter the User information to search for their profile



Step 3

: To access the Users Profile, select the arrow under "Profile" that is in-line with their User information



Step 4

: Select "Violations" from the navigation bar and then scroll to find the Violation you would like to reverse



Step 5

: Tick the corresponding box and then scroll to the top of the page and select "Delete" to remove it. Any reversed Violation will prompt the Appeals Team member to input a reason (e.g. *"Violation Reversed: User performed go-around as instructed and was not given ample time to react"*). 



> User notes **must**{.red} be recorded to monitor for possible User trends, Appeal Team actions, and identify repeat offenders. If for any reason a User Note was not added, this **must**{.red} be brought to the attention of an IFC Moderator so that this can be corrected



### 7E.2.7

Below is a list of the different canned replies available that can be sent on the IFC. Appeals Team members **should**{.red} try to use these as often as possible to give Users a standardized experience, however at times it may be necessary to message outside of these or to customize them:



| Canned Reply                           | Recommended Usage                                            |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Appeals - 1st - Replay Request         | If no replay file has been sent                              |
| Appeals - 2nd - Correct Template Reply | If the original message includes all the information required to process the appeal *(see [7E.2.3](/guide/atc-manual/7e.-appeals/7e.2-appeals-process#7e.2.3) above)* |
| Appeals - Sending Options Only         | A customized message can be sent which includes the "Sending Options Only" if you do not want to send the full "Replay Request" message, and/or have already been in dialogue with the User |
| Appeals - Violation Removal            | If the violation has been removed                            |
