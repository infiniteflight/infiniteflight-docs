# ATIS, Pushback and Taxi



## ATIS Communication Summary

Once spawned, the pilot will automatically be tuned to the ATIS frequency if it is currently staffed by a Controller. The current ATIS will continue to broadcast until the pilot tunes out.



![Tuned to ATIS](_images/manual/frames/tuned-to-atis.jpg)



1. As the ATIS is broadcast, it will appear at the top of your screen.

    

2. An 'on screen' notification will appear to inform you that you have been automatically tuned to an active frequency, you can tap it to dismiss the message.

    

3. The Communication button (headset icon) can be tapped to change frequencies, transmit/respond to ATC messages and to view the message log.

    


![ATIS Communication Box](_images/manual/frames/atis-communication-box.jpg)



1. The top left corner of the communication box shows which airport the respective controller is transmitting from, the elevation, and the Controller’s frequency. The Controller’s facility and their display name is shown on the second line and the airport’s METAR is on the third line.

    

2. The back button can be used to select other frequencies or to tune out of the current frequency.

    

3. The last altitude, heading, speed and runway assignment issued by ATC as a reminder (these will be blank until instructions are transmitted).

   

4. The message log displays all communication history, double tap it to just show your communication with ATC.




Tip

: When listening to the ATIS, use this opportunity to plan your taxi route to the most likely runway that you will be sent to based on position and runway(s) in use for departure. Having a planned taxi route will help reduce your workload and make ground movement errors less likely!



## ATIS Definitions

Below are two tables that define the meaning of all REMARKS and NOTAMS that may be present in an ATIS broadcast:



| REMARKS                           | ATC Intention                                                | Pilot Actions                                                |
| :-------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| No Intersection Departures        | ATC require pilots to use the full length of the runway.     | The pilot should hold short at the end of the runway.        |
| No Pattern Work                   | ATC is not accepting pattern work.                           | The pilot should not attempt to fly patterns at the airport, this does not include flying inbound for a touch & go landing provided the pilot then departs the airspace. |
| Flow Control                      | ATC is controlling the departure rate.                       | The pilot should expect a delayed departure.                 |
| Long Taxi                         | ATC may not send departures to the closest runway.           | The pilot should expect to be sent to a runway that requires a long taxi time. |
| Gate Hold                         | ATC needs to freeze all outbound ground movement.            | The pilot should hold at their gate until the hold is lifted, do not send duplicate pushback requests. |
| No Light Aircraft                 | Light aircraft (XCub, C172, P38, SR22, and Spitfire) are not allowed in the airspace or at the airport. | The pilot, if flying a light aircraft, must divert to or respawn at a different airport. |
| Rolling Departures                | ATC would like to expedite departures.                       | When cleared for take-off, the pilot should enter the runway and begin their take-off roll immediately. |
| Flight Plan Required              | ATC would like the pilot to file a flight plan before pushback/taxiing. | The pilot must file a flight plan before requesting pushback. |
| Straight Out Departures           | ATC would like aircraft to maintain runway heading until the altitude sent with the takeoff clearance is reached AND they are clear of traffic. | The pilot should fly straight until at the assigned altitude AND clear of all traffic before making any directional changes. |
| Multiple Frequencies in Use       | Controllers are using multiple frequencies to manage traffic. | The pilot should check the ATIS for the frequency to contact from their current position, and be ready to change frequencies at any time. |
| Check Forum for Event Information | ATC is referring pilots to special instructions on the IFC pages (i.e. FNF, VARB Summit) | The pilot should check the forum before flying.              |
| SID/STAR Use Recommended          | SID/STAR use is not essential for traffic management but is recommended. | The pilots should add a SID/STAR to their flight plan.       |
| SID/STAR Use Required             | SID/STAR use is essential for traffic management or events.  | The pilot must add an ATC preferred SID/STAR to their flight plan. |

| NOTAMS                     | ATC Intention                                     | Pilot Actions                                                |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Event in Progress          | An event is in progress.                          | The pilot may experience delays or, depending on the event, will not be allowed to participate. |
| Size Restrictions in Place | The airport cannot handle certain sized aircraft. | The pilot should think about the size of their aircraft in relation to the airport. |
| Severe Weather             | Extreme weather conditions have been reported.    | The pilot should expect high winds/turbulence.               |
| Low Visibility             | Low visibility has been reported.                 | The pilot should expect low visibility.                      |



## Pushback Communication Summary

## Pilot to Ground Controller Communication Table

| Request/Message                   | When to Send                                                 | When Not to Send                                             |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Request Taxi to an Active Runway  | Sent when the pilot does not have a runway preference.       | The pilot should not send this when they are actively pushing back. |
| Request Taxi to a Specific Runway | Sent when the pilot has a runway preference.                 | The pilot should not request an inactive runway, determined by the current ATIS. |
| Request Pushback                  | When the pilot wishes to pushback, they should request a pushback clearance. | This should not be requested if the user is piloting an aircraft without pushback capabilities (C172, C208, TBM-930, SR22, XCub, F18, F22, F16, F14, A-10, Spitfire, or P-38) or is in a parking space that does not require a pushback. |
| Request Runway Crossing           | If the pilot's taxi route requires them to cross a runway, they must request permission to cross. The requested runway should be the same as the runway in use. | In any other circumstance.                                   |
| Request Frequency Change          | The pilot should request a frequency change if they wish to change frequencies and have not yet been given a clearance to do so. | The pilot should not request a frequency change from Ground when they are taxiing to a runway. The frequency change is included in the taxi instruction (“contact Tower when ready”). |
