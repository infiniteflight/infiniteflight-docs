# Landing



## What is a safe Landing?

For a safe landing to be assured, the following criteria must always be met:

| Criteria            | Why                                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Landing Performance | This is to ensure that the Landing Distance Available (LDA) is a suitable length for the aircraft type |
| Stable Approach     | The Stable Approach Criteria (SAC) must always be met on an approach |
| Safe Touchdown      | This is to ensure normal runway contact - within the aircraft limits, touchdown zone and runway edge |
| Safe Rollout        | Aircraft decelerates in a manner which assures a safe stop prior to the runway end |



## Flare Height

The height at which the flare is initiated can vary significantly, the following factors should always be taken into account when determining the correct height:



- Aircraft type
- Aircraft weight
- Airport elevation
- Steeper approach slope (compared to the nominal 3 degrees)
- Tailwind
- Runway slope



## Type of Landing



| Type         | Definition                               |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Full Stop    | A normal landing which ends with the aircraft exiting the runway |
| Touch & Go   | A normal landing followed by a take-off, without coming to a full stop |
| Stop & Go    | A normal landing coming to a full stop, followed by a take-off from that position |
| Low Approach | A [go-around](/guide/flying-guide/descent-to-landing/go-around-baulked-landing#go-around%2Fbaulked-landing) maneuver following an approach |



## Landing Technique 

Once you have clearance (if applicable) and the runway is completely clear, you can follow the steps below to land:



Step 1

: Prior to the flare, avoid destabilization of the approach - look to the end of the runway to help you judge the flare height



Step 2

: At the appropriate height for that aircraft and the environmental conditions, perform the flare maneuver and reduce power to idle



Step 3

: Hold the selected landing attitude until touchdown



Tip

: We recommend you do not continue to pull back to elongate the flare in an attempt for a smooth touchdown; this increases the risk of not achieving the safe touchdown criteria, and also a tail strike is more likely! 



Step 4

: If at any time, a safe landing is not assured, perform a [go-around](/guide/flying-guide/descent-to-landing/go-around-baulked-landing#go-around%2Fbaulked-landing) or [baulked landing](/guide/flying-guide/descent-to-landing/go-around-baulked-landing#what-is-the-difference-between-a-go-around-and-a-baulked-landing%3F) procedure.



## Rollout and Runway Exit (Full Stop)

Step 1

: On touchdown, select reverse (if fitted), ensure that the [spoilers](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) have deployed (if fitted) and monitor the deceleration of the aircraft



Step 2

: Use the [rudder](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) to maintain the runway centerline. As speed decreases, so does the aerodynamic effect of the rudder, more input will be required at slower speeds



Step 3

: Modulate your [braking](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) and use of reverse (if fitted) to exit the runway expeditiously, but in a controlled manner. You should always plan in advance your exit strategy, but be flexible; the aircraft may decelerate faster or slower than you were expecting



Tip

: Rapid Exit Taxiways (RETs) have design exit speeds which can be very high - however due to the [Ground Overspeed Level 1 Violation](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/violations#what-are-violations%3F), we recommend you do not exceed 35kts whilst exiting the runway. For exits that are 90 degree turns, your groundspeed should be under 10kts



Step 4

: There are some airports which may require a back-taxi to exit the runway. Check out our [Back-Taxi](/guide/flying-guide/take-off-to-cruise/back-taxi#back-taxi) page for a step by step guide



Step 5

: When exiting the runway, keep moving until the aircraft is completely past the hold short line to ensure that the runway is clear for the next departure/arrival. You should always avoid coming to a complete stop and [try communicate with ATC](/guide/flying-guide/atc-communication/landing-and-taxi-to-parking#taxi-to-parking-communication-summary) (if present) whilst on the move to avoid a traffic jam behind you!



## How to perform a Touch & Go

Once you have clearance (if applicable) and the runway is completely clear, you can follow the below steps to land:



Step 1

: On touchdown, ensure that the [spoilers](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) have deployed (if fitted) and monitor the deceleration of the aircraft - do not select reverse (if fitted)



Step 2

: Use the [rudder](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) to maintain the runway centerline. As speed decreases, so does the aerodynamic affect of the rudder, more input will be required at slower speeds



Step 3

: Retract [flaps](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) to a take-off setting and select [spoilers](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) to **OFF**



Step 4

: Once they are set, increase thrust to take-off power and proceed with a normal [take-off](/guide/flying-guide/take-off-to-cruise/take-off-and-initial-climb#take-off-and-initial-climb)



Tip

: For a Stop & Go, follow the same steps as above however, come to a complete stop before commencing the [take-off](/guide/flying-guide/take-off-to-cruise/take-off-and-initial-climb#take-off-and-initial-climb) roll



## How to perform a Low Approach

To perform a low approach, follow the same steps as a [Go-Around](/guide/flying-guide/descent-to-landing/go-around-baulked-landing#go-around%2Fbaulked-landing) procedure.
