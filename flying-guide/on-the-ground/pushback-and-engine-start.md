# Pushback and Engine Start            




## Preliminary Cockpit Preparation



After spawning, access the [Ground Services](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/ground-services) menu and select the following service (if available for that aircraft type): 



| Ground    | Action  |
| --------- | ------- |
| GND POWER | **TAP** |

{.checklist}



Then access the [Systems](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/systems#systems) menu and select the following:



| Electrical  | Action    |
| ----------- | --------- |
| Master Batt | **ON**    |
| APU*        | **START** |

{.checklist}

*If fitted – not all aircraft are currently equipped with an APU



| Lights | Action |
| ------ | ------ |
| Nav    | **ON** |

{.checklist}




| Passengers  | Action |
| ----------- | ------ |
| Seat Belts* | **ON** |
| No Smoking  | **ON** |

{.checklist}

*When you have finished refuelling



Access the [Ground Services](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/ground-services) menu and select the following services: 



| Ground   | Action  |
| -------- | ------- |
| PAX      | **TAP** |
| CATERING | **TAP** |
| CARGO    | **TAP** |

{.checklist}



> For ground services to be used the aircraft must be parked at a stand that is large enough for that aircraft type, the parking brake set and the engines and beacon set to off



## Pushback

 

Step 1

: Check surroundings to make sure it is clear, use the [Cameras](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/cameras#camera) and [Mini Map](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#mini-map) to help you. If ground services have been used, these must be deselected before pushback



> Make sure to have the APU running (if fitted) before disconnecting the ground power



Step 2

: Access the [Ground Services](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/ground-services) menu and deselect the following services if they have been selected (they will be highlighted in orange if they have been selected):

 

| Ground    | Action  |
| --------- | ------- |
| PAX       | **TAP** |
| CATERING  | **TAP** |
| CARGO     | **TAP** |
| GND POWER | **TAP** |

{.checklist}



> The ground services can be disconnected in any order and is usually done when that ground service has completed their assigned tasks as decided by the pilot



| Pushback   | Action  |
| ---------- | ------- |
| Attach Tug | **TAP** |

{.checklist}



Step 3

: Tune to the active frequency and [request pushback](/guide/flying-guide/atc-communication/atis-pushback-and-taxi#pushback-communication-summary), or if there is no active ATC, tune to the Unicom frequency – listen for traffic before starting your pushback

 

Step 4

: Access the [Systems](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/systems#systems) menu and select the following:

 

| Lights | Action |
| ------ | ------ |
| Beacon | **ON** |

{.checklist}



Step 5

: Access the [Ground Services](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/ground-services) menu and select the following:

| Pushback | Action  |
| -------- | ------- |
| Push     | **TAP** |

{.checklist}



> Your parking brake must be set to **OFF** before you can push



Step 6

: Make sure to have a plan on where to push. ATC may tell you what runway to expect for departure too. Use the [Cameras](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/cameras#camera) and [Mini Map](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#mini-map) throughout the pushback and the [Rudder](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls#flight-controls) for directional control

 

Step 7

: When you’re ready to stop the pushback, access the [Ground Services](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/ground-services) menu and select the following:

 

| Pushback   | Action  |
| ---------- | ------- |
| Push       | **TAP** |
| Detach Tug | **TAP** |

{.checklist}



> You should set your parking brake to **ON** once the push has been completed and before detaching the tug



Tip

:   When aligning your aircraft with the taxiway centerline, anticipation is required. Don’t forget that the larger the aircraft, the sooner you will have to start the turn!

## Auto Pushback

Auto Pushback will automatically position your aircraft at the point on the taxiway where either you or ATC have defined. This allows you to focus on other things, such as 
[engine start](#Engine-Start). See the below video for more information

Pitch to zoom in/out as required

1. Compass - Use to comply with ATC "Tail to the (Direction)" instructions
2. Point at which the aircraft will pushed back to
3. Point at with the aircraft will be pulled forward to (Optional)
4. Start/End Button - Used to Start the auto pushback sequence (Changes to End once started)
5. Pause/Resume Button - Used to pause/resume the auto pushback sequence
6. Pressing either "Detach Tug" or "Auto Pushback" will exit the Auto Pushback mode/camera


## Engine Start

Engine start can commence during or after the pushback.

 

Step 1

: Check surroundings to make sure it is clear, use the [Cameras](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/cameras#camera) and [Mini Map](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#mini-map) to help you

 

Step 2

: Access the [Systems](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/systems#systems) menu and select the following:

 

| Engines       | Action  |
| ------------- | ------- |
| Eng ‘X’ 0% N1 | **TAP** |

{.checklist}



The start sequence for the engine you have selected will begin.

 

Tip

:   For a realistic experience, start one engine at a time - wait for the % N1 to be green before starting the next engine.

 

Alternatively you can use the **Auto Start** function for a more easy experience, select the following:

 

| Misc       | Action  |
| ---------- | ------- |
| Auto Start | **TAP** |

{.checklist}



Step 3

: Once at least one engine is running, access the [Systems](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/systems#systems) menu and select the following:

 

| Electrical | Action  |
| ---------- | ------- |
| APU*       | **OFF** |

{.checklist}



*If fitted – not all aircraft are currently equipped with an APU
