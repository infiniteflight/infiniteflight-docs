# TFRs and NOTAMs



## What are TFRs and NOTAMs?

![KASE and KEGE Active TFRs](_images/manual/frames/tfr.png)



A Temporary Flight Restriction, referred to as a TFR, is a block of airspace that has had restrictions put in place. In real life this could be due to numerous factors such as:



- movement of government officials
- natural disasters
- or other special events



A NOTAM (or Notice to Airmen), is a notice that has been put in place to ensure pilots are aware of potential hazards along their route, this can include at their departure, destination and/or alternate(s).



Within Infinite Flight, TFRs/NOTAMs can be found on the Expert Server and are depicted by red/orange circles (which can vary in size). They are used for airports that have permanent restrictions or temporarily for special events. The different colors and their meaning is shown below:



| Color  | Meaning  |
| ------ | -------- |
| Red    | Active   |
| Orange | Inactive |

## How to comply with TFRs/NOTAMs

To avoid violations being issued due to not complying with active TFRs/NOTAMs, the following steps are recommended:



Step 1

: Once you have filed your [flight plan](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#flight-planning) (if applicable), check the route on your [map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#map) or [mini map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#mini-map) for any red/orange circles



Step 2

: If you will be passing through/coming close to any of these TFRs/NOTAMs, or your destination(s) have TFRs/NOTAMs, then tap on (or close to) the circle on your map/mini map



Step 3

: Select the TFR/NOTAM from the dropdown list



Step 4

: The information associated with that TFR/NOTAM will be displayed, check to see if it is active, or will be active when you are flying near to it



Tip

: Once TFRs/NOTAMs become active, all aircraft must comply with them, regardless of when your flight was started



Step 5

: If it is or will be active, and you will be flying through it (i.e. within the floor to ceiling range), then ensure that you fully comply with the TFR/NOTAM before departure



Tip

: If you are outside of the radius or altitude of the active TFR/NOTAM, then the TFR/NOTAM does not apply to you (e.g. if the TFR/NOTAM has a ceiling of 10,000ft and you are higher than this, you can ignore the TFR/NOTAM) 



Step 6

: If you are unable to comply with the TFR/NOTAM, then change your routing, altitude and/or destination as appropriate to avoid being [issued with a violation](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/violation-reasons#failure-to-follow-tfr)



Step 7

: We also recommend checking the [IFC](https://community.infiniteflight.com) for upcoming events that may have temporary TFRs/NOTAMs added, as these may not be displayed on your [map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#map) or [mini map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#mini-map) yet
