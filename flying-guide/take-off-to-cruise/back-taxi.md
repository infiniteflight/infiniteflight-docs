# Back-Taxi



## What is a Back-Taxi?



Back-Taxi is a ground procedure which involves the use of any portion of a runway as a taxiway for an aircraft to taxi in the opposite direction from which it will take-off in, or has landed on.



Sometimes holding points are not positioned at the runway ends which prevents you from accessing the full length, in this case you may find that you are either told to Back-Taxi by ATC, or need to Back-Taxi to get the required runway length for departure. This could also be the case when landing, the exit points might not be located in a convenient location and a back-taxi may be required to exit the runway.



## How do I Back-Taxi?



Step 1

: Check surroundings to make sure it is clear, use the [Cameras](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/cameras#camera) and [Mini Map](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/mini-map#mini-map) to help you



Step 2

: Tune to the active frequency and [report ready for departure](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/communication#communication), or if there is no active ATC, tune to the Unicom frequency



Step 3

: Once you have clearance (if applicable) and it is clear on the approach; access the [Systems](/guide/getting-started/pilot-user-interface/systems#systems) menu and select the following:

 

| LIGHTS  |        |
| ------- | ------ |
| Strobes | **ON** |
| Land    | **ON** |

{.checklist}

 

Step 4

: If you have been cleared to Back-Taxi and Line Up and Wait (LUAW) by ATC, taxi onto the runway in the opposite direction in which you are planning to take-off in, and continue until you are happy with the amount of runway you have behind you. Once you have done this make a 180 degree turn and align  yourself with the centerline ready for take-off (you do not need to taxi to the runway end if you do not need it).



Tip

:   Although there is no groundspeed limit when on the runway, we recommend not exceeding 35kts in a straight line, and below 10kts when making a turn 



Step 5

: If you have just landed and pass the last usable exit, you will be cleared to Back-Taxi and contact Ground when off the runway by ATC, wait until you are at a sensible speed before attempting to make a 180 degree turn. 



Tip

: Familarise yourself with the ground layout of an airport before landing so that you can plan your exit strategy. Landing in the touchdown zone and using the correct amount of braking is sometimes all that is needed to prevent a back-taxi and save the workload of not only you, but also the ATC
