## Will I have to Repurchase IAPs again every time I Download Infinite Flight?

All App Stores selling Infinite Flight and it’s associated in-app purchases allow for downloading without repurchasing after an item has been paid for. If you’re an Android user your previous purchases will automatically be unlocked when you download the app. Apple users must open the aircraft selection page, then tap “Restore Purchases” to access any purchased regions and aircraft. To ensure success, please check the following:



- You have used the same App Store account and ID as the original purchase

- You have not been previously refunded

- You are not using any IAP hacking programs

  

*Note: If none of the above are applicable, a simple uninstall / reinstall often resolves the issue.*

Additionally, we strongly recommend that your device has **at least** 2GB+ of internal device memory (RAM).



*Note: Due to the large variety of Android devices, there is not a full list of devices supported although the vast majority can be found [here](https://community.infiniteflight.com/t/device-compatibility-thread-19-4-built-by-us-for-you/323610). Customers with devices that are not supported at this time will receive a message on the Google Play Store when attempting to download the latest update for Infinite Flight to advise that the device in use is not supported.*



Tip

: If your device doesn’t have a 64-bit processor and cannot be upgraded to Android 7.0, you will still be able to enjoy Infinite Flight on versions prior to 21.1. To find out if your device meets these requirements, check [here](https://community.infiniteflight.com/t/21-1-android-support/560936)



## I want a Refund. How Should I Proceed?

If you are experiencing difficulty with Infinite Flight, please allow us the opportunity to help resolve your issue first by contacting us at [support@infiniteflight.com](mailto:support@infiniteflight.com).

Please see below how each App Store handles refunds:

**Apple:** iTunes policy is that all app sales are final. We are not able to provide refunds, but you may be able to receive a refund by emailing iTunes customer service making your request.

**Android:** Google Play Store offers a two hour grace period to request a full refund for any purchase. Following the two hour grace period all refunds need to be requested with the developer by providing a complete copy of the receipt which shows the purchase ID beginning with “GPA”. **Refunds are not guaranteed and will be reviewed on a case by case basis.**



## Can I Recover my Purchases if I Switch from Apple to Android or Vice Versa?

Unfortunately purchases made through the App Store or Google Play Store do not transfer to the opposing App Store, whether Apple or Android. Each App Store has control over their own purchases, not allowing them to be honored by the opposite store, much like a game for Xbox would not be recognized by PlayStation.



## Will New Updates be Available on the Amazon App Store?

Unfortunately new updates will not be released for Amazon devices. We will gauge Amazon demand at a later date to determine whether or not we will continue to support the Amazon App Store updates. The version prior to global flight will remain available at this time.



## How can I Join the Beta Team?

We do not accept direct requests to be an Alpha or Beta Tester or currently do not offer an open beta version of Infinite Flight. Keep an eye out here on the [Community Forum](https://community.infiniteflight.com) for future openings!

## I just Fell Down Through the Ground or Got Stuck in a "Pothole"

This usually happens when the scenery stream from our servers to your device becomes corrupt for some reason.



**To resolve this issue, please try the following steps:**



Step 1

Step 2

: Before starting a new flight, go to Settings > General > Tap “Clear scenery cache” (it’s at the bottom)



Step 3

: Start a flight (try on Solo first)



*Note: In some rare cases, the steps above might not be enough. If that should be the case, you will have to reinstall Infinite Flight.*

## I can't Connect to ForeFlight or another Third-Party App



If you are having issues connecting to a third-party app such as ForeFlight, the following steps can help:



Step 1

: Ensure you are connected on the same WiFi network as the device running the third-party app



Step 2

: Ensure "Infinite Flight Connect" and "ForeFlight Link" are both enabled in Settings > General



Step 3

: Check you have permission to communicate with other devices on the local network. This varies on Android, but on iOS, a popup will appear that you must select "OK" to (if you selected no, you can go to iOS Settings > Infinite Flight and tick "Local Network")

## Google Play is showing "This app isn't compatible with your device anymore".

This alert will show if your device does not support the latest update of Infinite Flight, or if your device is not Google Play Protect certified. The following steps will help you determine this:

Step 1

 : Ensure your device meets the [minimum device requirements](/guide/get-help/general#what-are-the-minimum-device-requirements-for-infinite-flight%3F). If it doesn't, then you will not be able to update Infinite Flight to the latest version.

Step 2

 : Check to see if your device is Google Play Protect certified. You can do this by opening the Google Play Store, tap on Main Menu -> Settings and check "Play Protect certification" under "About" (should say "Device is certified").

If your device is not certified, this is because Google cannot validate the security or compatibility status of your device.

Ensure the following:

 - Your device's bootloader is *locked*.

 - Your device has the latest official software update from your manufacturer.

 - Your device is on the list of [Google Play's support devices](https://storage.googleapis.com/play_public/supported_devices.html)

 You can read more on the [Google Support website](https://support.google.com/android/answer/10248227?hl=en-GB#zippy=%2Cdevice-isnt-certified).
