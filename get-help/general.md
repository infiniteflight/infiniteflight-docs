## Will I have to Repurchase IAPs again every time I Download Infinite Flight?

All App Stores selling Infinite Flight and it’s associated in-app purchases allow for downloading without repurchasing after an item has been paid for. If you’re an Android user your previous purchases will automatically be unlocked when you download the app. Apple users must open the aircraft selection page, then tap “Restore Purchases” to access any purchased regions and aircraft. To ensure success, please check the following:



- You have used the same App Store account and ID as the original purchase

- You have not been previously refunded

- You are not using any IAP hacking programs

  

*Note: If none of the above are applicable, a simple uninstall / reinstall often resolves the issue.*



## What are the Minimum Device Requirements for Infinite Flight?

Our minimum device requirements for the Global versions of Infinite Flight is as follows:

**iOS:**

Additionally, we strongly recommend that your device has **at least** 1GB+ of internal device memory (RAM).



*Note: Due to the large variety of Android devices, there is not a full list of devices supported although the vast majority can be found [here](https://community.infiniteflight.com/t/device-compatibility-thread-19-4-built-by-us-for-you/323610). Customers with devices that are not supported at this time will receive a message on the Google PlayStore when attempting to download the latest update for Infinite Flight to advise that the device in use is not supported.*



## I want a Refund. How Should I Proceed?

If you are experiencing difficulty with Infinite Flight, please allow us the opportunity to help resolve your issue first by contacting us at [support@infiniteflight.com](mailto:support@infiniteflight.com).

Please see below how each App Store handles refunds:

**Apple:** iTunes policy is that all app sales are final. We are not able to provide refunds, but you may be able to receive a refund by emailing iTunes customer service making your request.

**Android:** Google Play Store offers a two hour grace period to request a full refund for any purchase. Following the two hour grace period all refunds need to be requested with the developer by providing a complete copy of the receipt which shows the purchase ID beginning with “GPA”. **Refunds are not guaranteed and will be reviewed on a case by case basis.**



## Can I Recover my Purchases if I Switch from Apple to Android or Vice Versa?

Unfortunately purchases made through the App Store or Google Play Store do not transfer to the opposing App Store, whether Apple or Android. Each App Store has control over their own purchases, not allowing them to be honored by the opposite store, much like a game for Xbox would not be recognized by PlayStation.



## Will New Updates be Available on the Amazon App Store?

Unfortunately new updates will not be released for Amazon devices. We will gauge Amazon demand at a later date to determine whether or not we will continue to support the Amazon App Store updates. The version prior to global flight will remain available at this time.



## How can I Join the Beta Team?

We do not accept direct requests to be an Alpha or Beta Tester or currently do not offer an open beta version of Infinite Flight. Keep an eye out here on the [Community Forum](https://community.infiniteflight.com) for future openings!

## I just Fell Down Through the Ground or Got Stuck in a "Pothole"

This usually happens when the scenery stream from our servers to your device becomes corrupt for some reason.



**To resolve this issue, please try the following steps:**



Step 1

: Re-launch Infinite Flight (make sure you stop it from running in the background first)



Step 2

: Before starting a new flight, go to Settings > General > Tap “Clear scenery cache” (it’s at the bottom)



Step 3

: Start a flight (try on Solo first)



*Note: In some rare cases, the steps above might not be enough. If that should be the case, you will have to reinstall Infinite Flight.*
