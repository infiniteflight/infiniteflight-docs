> If you do not have a previous subscription using Google or Facebook, then you will need to use Infinite Flight to login. New subscriptions using Google or Facebook to login is no longer supported



## Unable to purchase a Pro subscription

If you find that you are unable to purchase a Pro subscription whilst following the steps above, it is likely due to one of the following reasons:



- Parental permissions are enabled which are preventing in-app purchases
- There is a problem with your network connection
- You do not have an official version of the app



To try to fix the issue we recommend checking parental permissions, restarting your device, and then ensuring you have a good network connection before trying again. 



## How to manage your subscription

If you decide to install Infinite Flight on a different device, your subscription can be passed over provided you are using the same Apple ID (for iOS) or Google Play account (for Android) that the previous subscription was purchased on.



If however, you are no longer using the same platform (i.e. iOS to Android or vice versa), or using a different Apple ID/Google Play account, then you will need to link your Community Forum Account first for it to be recognised. To do this, follow the steps below:



Step 1

: If no active subscription is detected, the "Get Pro" button will be displayed in the top right hand corner of the [Home Screen](/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/home-screen), tap it



Step 2

: A subscription pop-up will appear, from there, tap "I already have an account"



Step 3

: Tap "Sign In with Infinite Flight" and login to your existing Community Forum Account



If you are still unable to access your subscription after completing the steps above, please send an e-mail explaining the steps you’ve already taken as well as the information below to support@infiniteflight.com:

- Display Name and Callsign
- Device
- Complete Purchase Receipt showing date, item, and item number (beginning with GPA if Android User)



## How do I cancel my Pro subscription? 

Auto-Renew can be cancelled directly from the Google Play or App Store. Please find the instructions for your store below:
