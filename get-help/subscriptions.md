Step 5

: You will then be able to login using your account details from the [Infinite Flight Community Forum](https://community.infiniteflight.com). This will search for an active subscription (if your subscription has expired then you will need to select a payment option to continue)



## Unable to purchase a Pro subscription

If you find that you are unable to purchase a Pro subscription whilst following the steps above, it is likely due to one of the following reasons:



- Parental permissions are enabled which are preventing in-app purchases
- There is a problem with your network connection
- You do not have an official version of the app



To try to fix the issue we recommend checking parental permissions, restarting your device, and then ensuring you have a good network connection before trying again. 



## How to manage your subscription

If you decide to install Infinite Flight on a different device, your subscription can be passed over provided you are using the same Apple ID (for iOS) or Google Play account (for Android) that the previous subscription was purchased on.



If however, you are no longer using the same platform (i.e. iOS to Android or vice versa), or using a different Apple ID/Google Play account, then you will need to link your Community Forum Account first for it to be recognised. To do this, follow the steps below:



Step 1

: If no active subscription is detected, the "Get Pro" button will be displayed in the top left hand corner of the [Home Screen](/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/home-screen), tap it



Step 2

: A subscription pop-up will appear, from there, tap "More Options > Sign in with Infinite Flight"



Step 3

: You will then be able to login using your account details from the [Infinite Flight Community Forum](https://community.infiniteflight.com)



If you are still unable to access your subscription after completing the steps above, please send an e-mail explaining the steps youâ€™ve already taken as well as the information below to [support@infiniteflight.com](mailto:support@infiniteflight.com):

- Display Name and Callsign
- Device
- Complete Purchase Receipt showing date, item, and item number (beginning with GPA if Android User)



## How do I cancel my Pro subscription?

Step 3
