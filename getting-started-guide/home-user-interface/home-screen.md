## Aircraft Selection

When in [Free Flight](/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/mode#free-flight) mode, there are loads of different aircraft and liveries to choose from. Maybe it’s your favorite airline, or the aircraft you just completed your Private Pilots License in, the choices are endless!



![Aircraft Selection](_images/manual/frames/aircraft-selection-232.png)



1. The various airline manufacturers are displayed on the left side, such as Airbus and Boeing

     

2. Under each manufacturer, there is a list of aircraft types that you can scroll through

     

3. Once you have tapped on the aircraft you want to fly, you can select what livery you would like using the dropdown list or the arrows to cycle through them

     

4. Infinite Flight has been in constant development, and some of our earlier aircraft aren't the same standard as the latest aircraft in our fleet. If this box is ticked, all of our aircraft (including older, legacy aircraft) are shown on your list

     

5. If you have re-installed the app or paid for a Pro Subscription, tap "Restore Purchases" to make sure you have all of your purchased aircraft available for download

    

6. Tap "OK" once you have made your selection to return to the Free Flight page



## Airport and Gate Selection

When in [Free Flight](/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/mode#free-flight) mode, you can also select your starting location.



![Airport Selection](_images/manual/frames/airport-selection-233.png)

 

1. The search function allows you to find the airport you want with ease. If you know the ICAO four letter code (e.g. KSFO for San Francisco Intl.) then you can type some or all of this, and a list of options will appear. Alternatively, just type in some or all of the city/airport name

  ​    

2. Blue dots signify airports that have a tower facility (although it may not necessarily have active ATC) and magenta dots signify uncontrolled airports

     

3. Airports that have buildings added are marked with a "3D" symbol

    

4. In Single Player, you can park wherever you want. But in Multi Player all parking positions are size restricted. If there are no parking positions available at an airport for the selected aircraft type, it will tell you the airport is too small when trying to select it

     

   Tip

   : [Select the aircraft](/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/home-screen#aircraft-selection) you want to fly before selecting a parking position, then you’ll be able to see where you can and can’t park

   

If you’re about to fly online, we also use a variety of colors to give you an idea of what the weather is like:

| Indication                                  | Meaning                      |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-vfr.png)  | Visual Flight Rules          |
| ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-mvfr.png) | Marginal Visual Flight Rules |
| ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-ifr.png)  | Instrument Flight Rules      |



![Gate Selection](_images/manual/frames/gate-selection-233.png)



1. Runway color codes help you know where the wind is coming from and which runways are "most likely" in use. But watch out, sometimes controllers will be using a different runway than you’re expecting, make sure to look out for traffic! Check out the table below:

   | Indication                                    | Meaning                                                      |
   | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-green.png)  | Headwind above 3kts (or wind from any direction when under 3kts) - runway recommended |
   | ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-orange.png) | Crosswind above 3kts                                         |
   | ![](_images/manual/tables/weather-red.png)    | Tailwind above 3kts - runway not recommended                 |

   

2. In Single Player, you can park wherever you want. But in Multi Player all parking positions are size restricted. If the parking position is marked red, you're too big!

    

   Tip

   : [Select the aircraft](/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/home-screen#aircraft-selection) you want to fly before selecting a parking position, then you’ll be able to see where you can and can’t park

   

3. Once you’ve decided on your spawn point, you’ll be able to see what airport and gate has been selected in the top right of your device on the card
