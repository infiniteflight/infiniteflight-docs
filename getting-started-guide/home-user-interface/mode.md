Location (airport/stand) selection - this search function allows you to [find the airport](/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/home-screen#airport-and-gate-selection) you want with ease. If you know the ICAO four letter code (e.g. KSFO for San Francisco Intl.) then you can type some or all of this, and a list of options will appear. Alternatively, just type in some or all of the city/airport name (only available in [Free Flight](/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/mode#free-flight) mode)
