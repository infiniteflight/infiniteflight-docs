# Settings

The Settings menu allows you to customize your Infinite Flight experience before and during play. Below is a guide to help you navigate your way around and to find the best settings for you!


![General Settings](_images/manual/frames/settings-general-243.png)


1. On the left hand side of the screen are 5 categories that split the settings up, tap each one to find settings within

   

2. Each setting is labelled and has a brief description beneath it

   

3. On the right hand side of the screen you can select that setting by tapping the box which will insert a tick to indicate it has now been set

   

4. Some settings have a label instead of a box, by tapping the label it will give you the option to change this to another setting (again, once set a tick is shown)

   

5. The Back button will take you back to the [home screen](/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/home-screen)

Tip

: Disable auto-coordination for more control and stability during [crosswind take-offs](/guide/flying-guide/take-off-to-cruise/crosswind-tailwind-take-off-technique#crosswind-take-off) & [landings](/guide/flying-guide/descent-to-landing/crosswind-tailwind-landing#crosswind-landing)



## Graphics

Infinite Flight supports both iOS and Android devices; because of this, the settings may need to be changed to ensure optimum performance. Unfortunately, not all devices are able to perform with all settings on high. Different combinations of high, medium and low may be required. For a detailed look at what graphics settings each device can handle, take a look at [this](https://community.infiniteflight.com/t/device-compatibility-thread-20-3-built-by-us-for-you/323610) topic on the Infinite Flight Community Forum.

## Online

 

![Online Settings](_images/manual/frames/settings-online-243.png)



| Setting                                         | What it does                                                 |

**Follow the steps below to download new pilot voices:*

- *iOS: Settings > Accessibility > Spoken Content > Voices*
- *Android: General Management > Language & Input > Text-To-Speech Output > Tap on Setting right of Preferred Engine > Install Voice Data*



## Audio

There are two sliders that adjust the SFX and ATC Volume. Slide your finger along the slider to find the desired setting.



![Audio Settings](_images/manual/frames/settings-audio-243.png)



| Setting                                 | What it does                                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SFX Volume (Sound Effects Volume)       | This volume will adjust aircraft and environmental sounds (engines, flaps, interior, exterior, wind, city etc) |
| ATC Volume (Air Traffic Control Volume) | This volume will adjust how loud/quiet the Air Traffic Controllers are when speaking |



Tip

: For both of these settings, try to find a happy medium where you can enjoy the sounds of the aircraft whilst being able to hear Controllers and not miss a radio call. In addition, you will also be able to use your device volume to adjust the overall volume



## Controls

In the control settings you can adjust your control sensitivity for each axis as well as customize your settings for joysticks, keyboards or other controlling devices. The 2 axes that your device’s accelerometers utilize are:



| Setting | What it does                                                 |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Roll    | Roll is the movement around the longitudinal axis (the longitudinal axis runs from the nose to the tail). This is left/right (banking) motion which is accomplished through the use of the ailerons found on the wings |
| Pitch   | Pitch is the movement around the lateral axis (the lateral axis runs from one wing tip to the other). This is the nose up/down motion through the use of the elevator as found on the tail |
| Yaw*    | Yaw is the rotation around the vertical axis. This motion is translated into the form of turning the nose left or right through the rudder on the tail |



**Yaw is the third axis; however, it is not controlled via an accelerometer. You control Yaw through the use of the [Rud Brakes](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/flight-controls) slider as found on the bottom right corner when you spawn*




![Control Settings](_images/manual/frames/settings-controls-243.png)



1. Motion will allow you to customize your current device accelerometers (if you have a joystick or other controlling device connected, this tab will appear first)

2. Keyboard will allow you to customize the experience for any keyboard that is connected

3. The various options that can be linked to either your joystick or keyboard will be listed here

4. "Tap to Assign" will allow you to program the available command to your yoke, joystick, keyboard or other controlling device

5. Config will bring up the sensitivity (slider on the left) and dead zone (slider on the right) for pitch and roll which can be adjusted

6. Defaults will reset your control settings to the factory option

   Tip

   : If you’re having trouble with sensitivities or any other control issues, we recommend you use this

7. The filter can be used to see only commands that have been assigned



> You can bind an axis (such as roll) to more than one device, however it will only be fed from one device at a time. The order of priority is from left to right (connected device > motion > keyboard)



## ForeFlight




@[vimeo](421197610)



The EFB link allows Infinite Flight pilots to use ForeFlight and its many features as if they were in a real airplane. Practice approaches and procedures, and fly a route before spending that hard-earned money on fuel! You’ll have maps, approach plates, weather, performance data, traffic and synthetic vision right from your mobile device. With ForeFlight’s new connection method, we’ve put together this video to show you how to get started!
