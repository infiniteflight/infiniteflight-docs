## How to manage your subscription

If you decide to install Infinite Flight on a different device, your subscription can be passed over provided you are using the same Apple ID (for iOS) or Google Play account (for Android) that the previous subscription was purchased on.



If however, you are no longer using the same platform (i.e. iOS to Android or vice versa), or using a different Apple ID/Google Play account, then you will need to link your Community Forum Account first for it to be recognised. To do this, follow the steps below:



Step 1

: If no active subscription is detected, the "Get Pro" button will be displayed in the top left hand corner of the [Home Screen](/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/home-screen#home-screen), tap it



Step 2

: A subscription pop-up will appear, from there, tap "I already have an account"



Step 3

: Tap "Sign In with Infinite Flight" and login to your existing Community Forum Account



If you are still unable to access your subscription after completing the steps above, please send an e-mail explaining the steps youâ€™ve already taken as well as the information below to support@infiniteflight.com:

- Display Name and Callsign
- Device
- Complete Purchase Receipt showing date, item, and item number (beginning with GPA if Android User)



## How to revert to Default Account

Step 1

Step 2
