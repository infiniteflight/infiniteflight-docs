## Linking Community Forum Account

[Callsigns](/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/user-profile#callsigns) are used whilst flying to identify you and for the Air Traffic Controllers to communicate with you. In addition to this, a unique user identifier is shown by default. If, however, you have an [Infinite Flight Community](https://community.infiniteflight.com) (IFC) account, you can choose to have your username displayed alongside your callsign. To link your account, follow the steps below:

Step 2

: A pop up will appear to confirm that you are happy for your information to be shared between the *Infinite Flight* app and website. Tap "Continue"



Step 3

Step 4

: Once completed, it will return to the app and you will see that your IFC username is now displayed



Tip

: Don't want your IFC username to show in-flight? No problem! You can still link your account if you want to, then visit [Settings > Live](/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/settings#live) where you can un-tick the "Show Username In-Flight" box!

## The Grade Table

Tip

: Your Grade Table can be found by tapping your User Profile symbol and then the arrow next to your displayed grade 



The Grade Table is categorized into the following 4 sections:



- General Pilot Stats
- Level 1 Violations
- Level 2 Violations
- Level 3 Violations



![Grade Table](_images/manual/frames/stat-page-243.png)



1. The first column lists the parameters that determine your grade, these are listed in the table below

   

2. This column (displayed in white) shows what you have currently logged/received as a pilot

   

3. The final column shows the requirements that you need to meet in order to progress to the next grade:

   - green parameters mean you have met the requirements for the next grade
   - orange parameters mean that you are yet to meet the requirement - this may be due to a deficiency or an exceeded limitation

   

Below is a table that outlines the different Grade requirements:

| Requirement                                    | G1   | G2   | G3     | G4     | G5      |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---- | ---- | ------ | ------ | ------- |
| Min Total XP                                   | -    | 2000 | 50,000 | 80,000 | 175,000 |
| Min Total Flight Time                          | -    | 5    | 50     | 120    | 500     |
| Min Total Landings                             | -    | 25   | 100    | 400    | 800     |
| Min Flight Time (90 days)                      | -    | -   | -    | 30     | 70      |
| Min Landings (90 days)                         | -    | -   | -    | 100    | 180     |
| Max Level 1 Violations (24 hours)              | -    | 7    | 5      | 0      | 0       |
| Max Level 1 Violations (7 days)                | -    | 25   | 5      | 0      | 0       |
| Max Level 1 Violations/Landings Ratio (1 year) | -    | 0.8  | 0.5    | 0.22   | 0.05    |
| Max Level 2 Violations (1 year)                | -    | 10   | 5      | 4      | 2       |
| Max Level 3 Violations (7 days)                | -    | 5    | 0      | 0      | 0       |
| Max Level 3 Violations (1 year)                | -    | 10   | 5      | 4      | 2       |
| Max Combined Level 2 and 3 Violations (1 year) | -    | 10   | 5      | 4      | 2       |
|{.grade-table}||||||



Below is a table that outlines all the Grade Table parameters and a brief description of them:

| Parameter                              | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| XP                                     | This number is calculated through landings and flight time. This does not represent skill |
| Total Flight Time                      | This is the total flight time you have accumulated represented in hours (hrs) and minutes (mn) |
| Total Landings                         | This is the total number of recorded landings that you have  |
| Flight Time (90 days)                  | Number of hours accumulated in the last 90 days              |
| Landings (90 days)                     | Number of landings recorded in the last 90 days              |
| Level 1 Violations (24 hours)          | Total number of Level 1 Violations accumulated in the last 24 hours |
| Level 1 Violations (7 days)            | Total number of Level 1 Violations accumulated in the last 7 days |
| Level 1 Violations/Landing (12 months) | Your total amount of Level 1 Violations is divided by your Landings (in the last 12 months) to determine a Violation to Landing ratio* |
| Level 2 Violations (1 year)            | Total number of Level 2 Violations accumulated in the last 1 year |
| Level 3 Violations (7 days)            | Total number of Level 3 Violations in the last 7 days        |
| Level 3 Violations (1 year)            | Total number of Level 3 Violations accumulated in the last 1 year |
| All Violations (1 year)                | Total number of Level 2 and Level 3 Violations in the last 1 year |



*Examples of Violation to Landing Ratios:

- 10 Level 1 Violations (total) and 20 Landings (12 months) would give a ratio of **0.50**
- 10 Level 1 Violations (total) and 10 Landings (12 months) would give a ratio of **1.00**
- 20 Level 1 Violations (total) and 10 Landings (12 months) would give a ratio of **2.00**



## Callsigns

Callsigns are used while flying to identify you and for the Air Traffic Controllers to communicate with you. Follow the steps below to change your callsign: 



Step 1

: From the [home screen](/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/home-screen), tap mode in the bottom right corner of the screen



Step 2

: Toggle to Multi Player and then select Free Flight



Step 3

: Callsign will now be visible under the aircraft icon on the right of the screen, tap the arrow to open the page



Step 4

: Using the navigation bar on the left of the screen, you can either select the "Airlines" or "General Aviation" tabs



Step 5

: There are three columns displayed that can be used to customize your callsign. If you selected the "Airlines" tab, then you can scroll through the first column to select the airline you wish to use. The second column can be tapped to enter an alphanumeric identifier, tap "OK" when you are happy with your selection. Finally, a "Suffix" can be added by tapping the desired one. You can select "None" if you do not wish to use one



Tip

: Want a more realistic experience? Try to match your aircraft livery with the callsign you are using! As well as this, make sure to only add the "Heavy" suffix when you have a gross take-off weight of more than 300,000lbs (136,000kgs) and the "Super" suffix when operating the A380



Step 6

: If you selected the "General Aviation" tab, the same process as above applies however instead of the airline callsign, the "Country Code" is used instead



> There is also a search bar available to find the airline or general aviation code you want



Tip

: The country code applies to where the aircraft is registered - therefore it does not need to be the same as the country you are flying from/to!



## How to Format General Aviation Callsigns

Key:

- "AB" means any two letter combination, "ABC" means any three letter combination, and so on
- "12" means any two number combination, "123" means any three number combination, and so on



The table below shows the formatting that must be used when selecting an ID for a General Aviation callsign:
