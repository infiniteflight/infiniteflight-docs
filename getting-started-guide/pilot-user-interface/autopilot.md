# Autopilot

![Autopilot](_images/manual/frames/autopilot.png)



1. By tapping on the Autopilot (AP) symbol, the autopilot box will appear displaying the Flight Control Unit (FCU) options



Step 1

: To engage the autopilot, tap the "AP OFF" button (you must be airborne for the autopilot functions to work correctly). The button will be highlighted by an orange hollow box and will change to "AP ON"

Step 2

: Basic modes will automatically engage, these are current heading and vertical speed (VS)

Step 3

: Altitude (ALT), vertical speed (VS), altitude presets (ALT PRESETS), speed (SPD), heading (HDG), vertical navigation (VNAV), lateral navigation (LNAV GPS) and approach mode (APPR) can be engaged or disengaged by tapping each symbol. By pressing and holding on each symbol (with the exception of the AP, ALT PRESETS, VNAV, LNAV and APPR), and then moving your finger up or down, the value can be changed. For ALT PRESETS, just tap the button and a list of preset options will appear which can be selected (this will override any current altitude that is set in the ALT window)

Step 4

: The altitude and heading selections have turquoise bugs which appear on the [HUD](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/hud). These values can be pre-set before engagement of the Autopilot



## Use of Approach Mode

@[vimeo](495491039)



Aircraft may be fitted with the Approach (APPR) mode which allows the autopilot to intercept an ILS and perform an automatic landing if it is kept engaged until touchdown. Before engaging the APPR mode, make sure to check that the ILS has been [tuned](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/navigation#tuning-to-an-ils) and [displayed](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/navigation#displaying-an-ils-in-your-aircraft).

Tip

: APPR Mode is unable to activated if your airspeed exceeds 250 knots, or if your aircraft is over it's maximum landing weight




When pressing the APPR button, the following displays will be shown beneath it:

| Autopilot Mode                                 | Meaning                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "LOC ALT" (flashing amber)                     | The APPR mode has been armed                                 |
| "LOC" (solid green) and "ALT" (flashing amber) | The APPR mode is capturing or already established on the LOC, the G/S is armed and will capture provided you are below the G/S |
| "LOC GS" (solid green)                         | The APPR mode is capturing or already established on both the LOC and G/S |

For the best results, only engage the APPR mode when you are on an [intercept heading for the ILS](/guide/flying-guide/descent-to-landing/instrument-landing-system-(ils)-approach#what-is-an-ils-approach%3F) (we recommend no more than 30 degrees). Once engaged, the heading can still be adjusted. However once the LOC capture is in progress, the heading can no longer be changed. 



Tip

: If LNAV and VNAV are engaged and the APPR button is tapped, the last heading and vertical speed that the aircraft was flying will be maintained however this can result in abnormal autopilot behaviour
