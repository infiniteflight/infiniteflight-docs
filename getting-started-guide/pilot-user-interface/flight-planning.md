# Flight Planning



![Flight Plan Screen](_images/manual/frames/flight-plan-screen.png)



1. The Flight Plan (FPL) section shows your next waypoint (WPT), desired track (DTK), distance (DIST), estimated time en-route (ETE) and altitude (ALT). The active waypoint is always displayed in magenta. If the altitude displayed in orange or red it means that the rate of descent could be too high to this waypoint, so it's a good idea to investigate

   

2. The buttons at the bottom of the FPL page have the following functions:

   | Button        | Function                                                     |
   | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | -             | Delete a waypoint                                            |
   | Act. Leg      | Make a waypoint the active leg by selecting the waypoint, and then tapping this button |
   | Clear         | Clear entire flight plan                                     |
   | Up/Down Arrow | Move a waypoint or procedure up/down in your flight plan by selecting the waypoint/procedure, and then using the arrows to position it as desired |
   | OPT.          | Tap a waypoint and then this button to set/edit/delete an altitude target that can be used with VNAV. Tapping "Set Autopilot ALT" will change the altitude selected in the [autopilot](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/autopilot) to the altitude of the waypoint selected |
   | Double Arrow  | You can open a flight plan using this button, if you already have a flight plan you can [share](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#share-flight-plan) it, or you can load a flight plan from SimBrief |



3. The search function can be used to find any airport or waypoint in the database

   

   Tip

   : If you already have a route you want to fly, paste the route into the search function and it will automatically be populated into you Flight Plan (this can also include latitude/longitude coordinates)

   

4. You can tap any fix/airport/navigation aid on the map and add this to your Flight Plan using the "+" symbol. If you tap the symbol next to this, it will perform a "direct to" function and wipe all of your flight plan and go directly to the waypoint selected

   

5. In the bottom right of the screen are the settings, center screen and zoom in/out functions. Additionally, you can cycle the display between just the Map, Flight Plan, or both displayed. To customize your display, the settings below are available:

| Setting               | What it does                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Fixes                 | Show or hide GPS waypoints known as fixes                    |
| Navaids               | Show or hide navigation aids (VOR/NDB)                       |
| Airspaces             | Show or hide airspace                                        |
| Taxiways              | Show or hide taxiway lines                                   |
| Approaches            | Show or hide approaches                                      |
| Uncontrolled Airports | All airports represented by a magenta dot are either shown or hidden using this setting |



Tip

: If you're running an older device and/or experiencing "crashes", try selecting "Hide Airspaces" as this may improve your device performance!



## Adding Coordinates to your Flight Plan

The following format needs to be used when adding coordinates to a flight plan:



ddmmx/ddmmy



> **Key:**
>
> d - degrees
>
> m - minutes
>
> x - N or S
>
> y - E or W



When adding a coordinate, you will need to include at least one other waypoint or coordinate as it is not possible to add just one coordinate by itself. For example, if you wanted to add 55N050W (5500N/05000W using the above compatible format), you would need to select another coordinate or waypoint to add to the flight plan at the same time (e.g. 5500N/05000W 5500N/04000W 5500N/03000W etc.).



> It is currently not possible to add seconds so these will need to be rounded to the nearest minute when adding to your flight plan

## Map

![Map](_images/manual/frames/map-227-v2.png)

 

1. Airports are always represented by either blue or magenta dots, if you’re flying online they may also have a [colored dot in the middle](/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/home-screen#airport-and-gate-selection) for reference to the weather



2. VOR (Very High Frequency [VHF] Omnidirectional Range) navigation aids are represented by this symbol. They can be tuned to either NAV 1 or 2, if fitted on your selected aircraft

   

3. NDB (Non Directional Beacon) navigation aids are represented by this symbol. They can be tuned to ADF 1 (Automatic Direction Finder), if fitted on your selected aircraft

   

4. A GPS (Global Positioning System) Fix is represented by this symbol

   

5. In the bottom right of the screen is settings, center screen and zoom in/out functions. Additionally, you can cycle the display between just the Map, Flight Plan, or both displayed



6. By tapping anywhere on the map, a drop down list will appear with anything close to that point. You can select which one you want from the list for more info. If it is a fix/navaid you can tap the "+" symbol to add it to your Flight Plan, or the symbol next to this to perform a "direct to" function

   ![Information Tab](_images/manual/frames/map2-227-v2.png)

   

7. If you have tap anything on the list, a "more info" tab will appear. If it was an airport that was tapped, additional tabs for weather, runways and procedures will also be available

     

8. If it was an aircraft that was tapped, there is the ability to copy their flight plan by tapping "Copy FPL"  

## Mini Map

![Mini Map](_images/manual/frames/mini-map.png)



1. The mini map is a great tool to be able to see where other aircraft are, to view your flight plan, and to discover your surroundings whilst you fly – just scroll your finger around the map to explore

   

2. Customizable settings, the zoom in/out function and a center screen button are available on the mini map by just tapping it



## Getting more from your Map and Mini Map

@[vimeo](429308225)


Step 1

: By tapping anywhere on the map, a drop down list will appear with anything close to that point

 

Step 2

: You can select which one you want from the list for more info. If it is a fix/navaid you can tap the "+" symbol to add it to your Flight Plan, or the symbol next to this to perform a "direct to" function

 

Step 3

: If you have selected which one you want from the list, the information tab is displayed initially. If it was an airport that was selected, additional tabs for weather, runways and procedures will also be available

## View Winds Aloft Data on the Map

Wind speed and direction can be viewed on the map for a range of altitudes from surface level to FL430.
To enable this tap on the setting cog icon on the map, then tap on "Winds Aloft". This will add the layer to the map. 

Each of the icons on the map, known as wind barbs, provide you with the speed and direction of the wind. The direction the barb is facing is the direction the wind is blowing in. Speed is based on the number of lines (barbs) and triangles (pennants) shown. Each short barb (half line) is worth 5 knots, long barb (full line) is worth 10 knots, and each pennant (triangle) is worth 50 knots. See the below image for examples


![Winds Aloft](_images/manual/getting-started/flight-planning-wind-barbs.png)

1. By holding down and dragging on this control you are able to set the altitude of the wind data that is selected. Selecting "Auto" will use your aircraft's current altitude 
2. With 2 pennants (50), 3 long barbs (10) and 1 short barb (5), this represents 135 knots of wind from the west
3. With 1 pennant (50), 4 long barbs (10) and 1 short barb (5), this represents 95 knots of wind from the west-northwest
4. With no pennants (50), 4 long barbs (10) and 1 short barb (5), this represents 45 knots of wind from the southwest

## Selecting Departure, Arrival and Approach Procedures


@[vimeo](429377642)


Step 1

: Open the procedures tab by following the [step by step guide above](/guide/getting-started-guide/pilot-user-interface/flight-planning#getting-more-from-your-map-and-mini-map)



Step 2

: You have the option to select Departure (the SID), Arrival (the STAR) or Approach (what approach you want to fly)



Step 3

: Selecting Approach will give you a list of approaches (see tables below) for the different runways at your selected airport and  a preview will display on the map as you cycle through them. Tap "select" at the bottom when you have your desired approach



Tip

: Make sure to select one of the approaches that has been broadcast as in use on the ATIS (if ATC is present); or if uncontrolled, the approach that favors the weather and current traffic levels



Step 4

: Some approaches may give you a further option called a Transition. These usually start the approach from a navigation aid such as a VOR, but if you would prefer, you can just select "Vectors to Final" and the transition will not be included



Step 5

: Once you're happy with your selection you can tap "Add to Flight Plan". The "Back" button is available if you change your mind



Step 6

: You can now select an arrival and departure using the same technique as above



**The following prefixes are used to help differentiate between the different approaches available at an airport:**

| Prefix | Meaning                                       |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| D      | VOR/DME Approach                              |
| H      | RNAV (RNP) Approach                           |
| I      | ILS Approach                                  |
| J      | GLS Approach                                  |
| L      | LOC (Localizer) Only Approach                 |
| N      | NDB Approach                                  |
| Q      | Combination (two or more) of ILS/DME/VOR/NDB  |
| R      | RNAV (GPS) Approach                           |
| S      | VOR Only Approach                             |
| X      | LDA (Localizer Type Directional Aid) Approach |



**After the prefix, the runway designator (such as 27 for Runway 27) will be shown. This will then be followed by any associated suffixes, these are shown in the table below:**

| Suffix    | Meaning                                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| L         | Left                                                         |
| R         | Right                                                        |
| Y or Z    | Differentiates between runways that utilize the same guidance |
| 1, 2 etc. | Indicates same guidance is being used to a runway but with different approach paths (commonly found on the VOR/DME/NDB approaches) |



**Example:**

H35LZ - RNAV (RNP) Approach for Runway 35L, Zulu Procedure
