# 10.2 Stand Guidance



Tip

: You may find it useful to zoom out to ensure that the stand guidance is pointing towards (and in-line with) the start location (in-line is defined as within +/- 5 degrees). The nearest start location (within 60m) that is in-line with the stand guidance, will be paired



### 10.2.1

Step 1

: Scroll up/down the list on the right of the screen to see the object repository (the "Library" tab **must**{.red} be selected)



Step 2

: Select the "Safedock T1" under "Stand Guidance"



Step 3

: Tap in the area of the airport that you want to add the object to (you may have to press and hold), this will place a white cursor. Adjust this as required and then tap "Add Object"



Tip

: You may find it easiest to place the stand guidance at the start location for that stand by tapping the start location (you may have to select the start location from a dropdown list)



Step 4

: Three circles will appear as well as a compass rose. Tap and hold on circle to move the object or to change height/orientation:



| Circle                         | Function                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Center                         | Will move the object by dragging your finger to the desired location |
| Top (just above center circle) | Will adjust the elevation or altitude of the object          |
| Outer                          | Will change the orientation of the object by dragging your finger in the direction you want to orientate it to |



Tip

: The stand guidance **should**{.red} be eye level with the aircraft that are designed to park at that stand, and **must**{.red} be positioned in the correct location for that stand (this may be on the terminal building or even on a "Generic Pole")



Step 5

: The stand guidance **must**{.red} be facing the start location, and in the correct orientation (i.e the side with sensors **must**{.red} be facing the start location)
