# 11.3 Jet Bridge Properties



### 11.3.1

Step 1

: Select the jet bridge by tapping on or near it *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 2

: You may have to select the jet bridge from a drop down box if there are multiple items in close proximity. The outline of the jet bridge will turn magenta to indicate it has been selected **(1)**



Step 3

: Tap the "Properties" tab **(2)** on the right side of the screen

Step 4

: You can then adjust the following properties for jet bridges in their stowed position (i.e. not connected to an aircraft):

## Adjusting Jet Bridge Base Height

### 11.3.2

The slope of a jet bridge between the base and end is limited (especially an issue if the jet bridge is short), therefore the base height may need to be adjusted to allow all applicable aircraft types that can spawn at that start location. Below is an example of a jet bridge which has not been adjusted to accommodate narrow body aircraft.

### 11.3.3

To do this, the following steps can be followed: 



Step 1

: Select the jet bridge base by tapping on or near the blue circle **(1)** that is in the center of it *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 2

: If there are multiple objects in close proximity, a list will appear so you can select the jet bridge base



Step 3

: Tap the "Properties" tab **(2)** on the right side of the screen and then the "+" symbol next to "Animations" **(3)**



Step 4

: A drop down list will appear, tap the "+" symbol next to "Height" **(4)**



Step 5

: This will further expand and by tapping this **(5)**, will allow you to change the height of the jet bridge base



Step 6

: Whilst the jet bridge base is still selected (which has the adjusted height) - use the rectangle selection tool *(see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)* or "Edit > Selection (Add)" to select all remaining jet bridge elements that you want the height adjusted for



Step 7

: Tap "Jet Bridge" and then "Adjust Jet Bridge Alt"


Tip

: Due to a bug with glass jetbridges, using "Adjust Jetbridge Alt." to connect an end section to a base, the end section will end up 0.060 too low. A workaround is to place the base 0.060 too high, use "Adjust Jetbridge Alt." and lower the base by 0.060 afterwards.

Step 8

: The height will be changed for all selected jet bridge elements to the same as the height of the jet bridge base

## A380 Gates

### 11.3.4

If the start location has three jet bridges, it will try to join the third jet bridge to door U1L (Upper 1 Left) of the A380. Editors **should**{.red} try to raise the base of the jet bridge *(see [11.3.3](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/11.-airport-gates/11.3-jet-bridge-properties#11.3.3) above)* as well as the stowed height *(see [11.3.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/11.-airport-gates/11.3-jet-bridge-properties#11.3.1) above)* to reduce the angle of the jet bridge when connected to the aircraft door.
