# 11.4 Jet Bridge Animations 



### 11.4.1

Once the start locations and jet bridges have been added, and the stowed positions of the jet bridges have been adjusted, Editors can move onto adding jet bridge animation. Below are the first steps that **must**{.red} be followed:



Step 1

: Check all start locations are named correctly. The following properties **must**{.red} be correct before moving onto Step 2:



| Property | Entry                                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Terminal | e.g. Concourse/Terminal/GA/Cargo/Apron/FBO etc. [name/number] |
| Name     | Gate [alphanumeric/number]*                                  |

**Editors **must**{.red} ensure that terminal names (e.g. T1) are not included in the "Name" property*



Step 2

: Tap the "Auto Assign Gates" button to bind each jet bridge to a stand



Step 3

: Above each jet bridge, it will show the start location(s) the jet bridge is assigned to (e.g. "Terminal 5/Gate 515")



Step 4

: If this is incorrect, tap the jet bridge required (if not already selected), then "Properties". Under "General" there is the "Gate" tab, tap this



Step 5

: The gates that are assigned to this jet bridge will be listed, these can be removed by tapping the "-" symbol next to it. If a gate needs to be added, enter the name of the gate by tapping the "+" symbol and then using the format "Terminal Name/Gate Name"



> Sometimes the auto assign function can incorrectly assign the jet bridge to a gate in close proximity that cannot be serviced by that jet bridge and therefore manual adjustment may be required



Step 6

: Check all start locations for jet bridges not reaching doors by tapping "Jet Bridges > Check Jet Bridges"



Step 7

: Below each start location, it will show the jet bridge status. The following color codes are used:



| Code                                              | Message                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "All Airplanes OK" - Green                        | For any start location that has a jet bridge, this **must**{.red} be the code displayed |
| "Jet Bridges [Aircraft Type* and Reason]" - Amber | Readjustment of the jet bridge is required as it is unable to reach some doors of the aircraft type(s) listed (partial) |
| "Jet Bridges [Aircraft Type* and Reason]" - Red   | Readjustment of the jet bridge is required as it is unable to reach any door of the aircraft type(s) listed |
| "No Jet Bridges Available" - Grey                 | Expected if the start location does not have a jet bridge    |

**No more than 2 aircraft types will ever be shown to avoid clutter*



Step 8

: If any start locations are not green (i.e amber or red), you **must**{.red} adjust the jet bridges to make the doors reachable *(see 11.4.2 below)*



Step 9

: Check that Airport Properties *(see [3.2.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/3.-getting-started/3.2-airport-properties#3.2.2) above)* has the "Jet Bridges Available" tick box selected (orange tick when selected) by tapping "File > Airport Properties > Jet Bridges Available"



> Jet bridges will not work in flight mode for pilots until this tick box is selected



## Adjusting Jet Bridges

### 11.4.2

Step 1

: All jet bridges **must**{.red} be checked, adjust any jet bridge that are red, amber or grey (for a start location that has a jet bridge) by first tapping "Jet Bridges" and then "Check Jet Bridges"



> Editors **must**{.red} ensure that even jet bridges that are green comply with Step 5 below



Tip

: Tap "Jet Bridges" and then "Freeze Non Jet Bridges" before attempting to move jet bridges, this freezes all other objects so you don't move something else by accident



Step 2

: Tap the end of the jet bridge **(1)**, a green arc will appear that shows the animation range of the jet bridge **(2)**



> The inner green curved line shows the minimum range of the center of the jet bridge rotation head when the jet bridge is fully retracted, and the outer green curved line shows the maximum possible extension of the jet bridge. Aircraft doors have to be within this green area to be reached by a jet bridge



Step 3

: In addition to the green arc, three circles as well as a compass rose are displayed. Use the outer circle to change the orientation of the jet bridge (and green arc) by tapping, holding and then dragging your finger on this circle **(3)**. This can be moved until the green arc is in an area that includes all applicable start locations

Tip

: The "Rotate Range +90" button can be used to move the green arc by 90 degrees while the orientation of the stowed jet bridge will stay the same (e.g. this can be useful when the green arc is covering more of the terminal than the gate area)



Step 4

: Re-tap "Jet Bridges" and then "Check Jet Bridges" and check to see that the locations are now shown in green **(4)**

Step 5

: Editors **must**{.red} ensure that the green arc covers as much of the start location as possible **(5)**. If more of the green arc is in an unusable position (such as the terminal), it could limit the jet bridge range **(6)**
