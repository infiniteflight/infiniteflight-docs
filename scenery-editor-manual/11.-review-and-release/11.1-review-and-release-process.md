# 11.1 Review and Release Process



### 11.1.1

In order to have your airport published in Infinite Flight, you **must**{.red} submit your airport for review so it can be checked for compliance with all rules defined in this manual. To assist with Reviewer workload a two stage review process is available as shown below:



| Review Type | Description                                                  | Who can Review    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Peer        | A voluntary step in the review process that **should**{.red} be done in order to get feedback from fellow Editors | Editor or above   |
| Official    | A mandatory review in which the airport **must**{.red} be submitted before it will be included in a release cycle | Reviewer or above |



### 11.1.2

Before submitting for a review, a Scenery Check **must**{.red} be completed to ensure that the airport is compliant with the limits put in place (i.e. performance limitations, objects outside the boundary, naming issues/duplicates of gates etc.):



Step 1

: Tap "File > Scenery Stats > Scenery Check > Check Scenery"



Step 2

: Any errors listed can then be found by tapping on an error and then "Select Items"



Step 3

: You will then be able to see the selected item on the airport and decide if it needs to be changed



## Peer Review 

### 11.1.3

Tip

: In order to upload your airport as a draft or for review, changes have to be made since the last uploaded version (this can be as minor as moving a cone)



Step 1

: Once an airport is completed, it **must**{.red} be uploaded using "File > File Manager > Upload as Draft" *(see [2.1.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.2) above)*. It can then be submitted for a "peer" review by posting a link to the IFC airport thread in the *#request-peer-review* Discord channel



> When only small changes are made (i.e. the airport is not fully reworked), Editors **should**{.red} provide a description which covers which particular changes have been made in the upload description. If changes are extensive, additional details **should**{.red} be given in the IFC airport thread



Step 2

: Once feedback is received, the Editor can then work on these changes before either re-submitting for another peer review, or for an official review. All feedback related to a review (both peer and official) **must**{.red} be conducted in the IFC airport thread to ensure a record is kept



> No more than 2 peer reviews can be given per airport, therefore airports **must**{.red} only be submitted for review when the Editor believes it is complete. If help or guidance is needed before an airport is complete, Editors **should**{.red} utilize the *#help* Discord channel to ask specific questions related to their airport



## Official Review

### 11.1.4

Tip

: In order to upload your airport as a draft or for review, changes have to be made since the last uploaded version (this can be as minor as moving a cone)



Step 1

: When the Editor is ready to submit for an "official" review, they can do this by using "File > File Manager > Upload for Review" *(see [2.1.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.2) above)*



> When only small changes are made (i.e. the airport is not fully reworked), Editors **must**{.red} provide a description which covers which particular changes have been made in the upload description. If changes are extensive, additional details **should**{.red} be given in the IFC airport thread



Step 2

: Feedback will be given by a Reviewer in the IFC airport thread. If additional changes are required, these **must**{.red} be resubmitted following the same process as outlined above



Step 3

: Once the airport is considered ready by the Reviewer, the airport will be marked as "Ready for Release" and will be included in a release cycle at some point



> Once your airport is "Ready for Release" it will not necessarily be released in the next cycle. This is because other factors also determine what is or isn't included in the release, more information can be found [here](https://community.infiniteflight.com/t/airport-releases/653276)
