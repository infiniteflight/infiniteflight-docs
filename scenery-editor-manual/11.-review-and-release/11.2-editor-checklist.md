# 11.2 Editor Checklist

Tip

: If help or guidance is needed before an airport is complete, Editors **should**{.red} utilize the *#help* Discord channel to ask specific questions related to their airport



### 11.2.1

Below is a checklist that editors **should**{.red} ensure is completed before marking an airport as complete and ready for review:

## Airport Properties

### 11.2.2

- [ ] All airport properties have been set
- [ ] All ATC frequencies have been added
- [ ] Scenery check has been carried out by tapping "File > Scenery Stats > Scenery Check > Check Scenery" and any errors listed (that need to be fixed) have been corrected



## Airport Boundary

### 11.2.3

- [ ] Anything outside of airport boundary has been removed (except for applicable airport equipment)

- [ ] Fences are joined properly and their orientations are consistent i.e. posts and rails join smoothly, end posts marry up to buildings (where applicable) and are aligned with pavements (where applicable)
- [ ] Correct fence selection has been made i.e. barb-wire vs no barb-wire
- [ ] When using the barb-wire fence, ensure that it is the correct orientation
- [ ] Motorized gates have been added at roadway entrances and exits (where applicable)



## Airport Equipment

### 11.2.4

- [ ] Airport beacon tower has been added (if applicable) in the position found IRL
- [ ] The beacon light has been added (if applicable) to the same location as the airport beacon/ATC tower

- [ ] VORs have been added to the 3D airport if present IRL (utilizing available imagery and airport charts)
- [ ] VOR sizing correctly portrays what is at the airport IRL i.e. VOR (small) or VOR has been placed within the airport boundary

- [ ] Runway guard lights (if applicable) have been provided at all applicable runway intersections 
- [ ] Runway guard lights are oriented respective to their IRL conditions either following straight taxi center lines or curved center lines so that they are visible to the PIC

- [ ] Localizers have been added in the position found IRL and in the correct orientation (i.e. box facing away from the runway end)
- [ ] Slope Antennas have been added in the position found IRL and oriented with the runway heading

- [ ] Wind socks are provided as close to IRL imagery and airport chart data (if available)
- [ ] ATC towers have been place in the position found IRL, and have the correct height set
- [ ] The tower view point is placed within the ATC tower cab



## Pavements

### 11.2.5

- [ ] All pavements found IRL have been added
- [ ] All pavements have been snapped without gaps
- [ ] Pavement patches are added on top of the surrounding pavements (i.e. no hole created underneath)
- [ ] Grass surface type is only used for grass taxiways (e.g. not used for grass outside a terminal)
- [ ] All pavements have the same surface type as found IRL



## Taxiways

### 11.2.6

- [ ] All taxiway lines found IRL have been added
  - [ ] Centerlines
  - [ ] Hold lines
  - [ ] Edge lines
  - [ ] Road and gate outlines
- [ ] All taxiway lines have the correct line types assigned as found IRL
- [ ] All taxiway lines have the correct light type assigned as found IRL
- [ ] All taxiway lines are snapped
- [ ] All taxiway centerlines and hold lines have been named
- [ ] Only taxiway centerlines and hold lines have the taxiway network usage type set to aircraft
- [ ] All other lines have the taxiway network usage type set to none
- [ ] All taxiway centerlines have the aircraft category set to the largest aircraft category that can use that taxiway
- [ ] All taxiway centerlines have the directions correctly set
- [ ] All taxiway connectors are placed (as required)
- [ ] Taxiway network has been built and checked
- [ ] "Taxiway Routes Available" tick box selected (orange tick when selected) by tapping "File > Airport Properties > Taxiway Routes Available"



## Start Locations

### 11.2.7

- [ ] Start locations are added for all parking positions as found IRL
- [ ] Start locations have the correct orientation
- [ ] Start locations have been appropriately named in both the "gate" & "terminal" text fields
- [ ] Start locations have the aircraft category set to the largest aircraft category that can use that start location
- [ ] Gate stops have been defined (as required)



## Buildings and Facades

### 11.2.8

- [ ] Buildings have been added respective to their locations IRL
- [ ] Building heights and roof depths appear realistic 

- [ ] Buildings are aligned with 2D Pavements
- [ ] Building layering is symmetrical and corners are accurately positioned at all intersections
- [ ] Roof orientations have been auto coordinated
- [ ] Facades are coordinated as close to IRL as possible

- [ ] Rooftop equipment such as air conditioners, cooling towers, ladders and catwalks have been positioned reflecting their position IRL
- [ ] Duplicate buildings have been removed if "Download OSM" and "Download OSM at Cursor" were utilized



## Objects

### 11.2.9

- [ ] Objects aren’t overcrowding ramps, gates, parking lots and staging areas

- [ ] No objects are clipping one another

- [ ] Vehicles are clear and free from roadways

- [ ] Firefighting trainer aircraft (if applicable) has been added



## Airport Gates

### 11.2.10

- [ ] Stand guidance added to any gates that have it IRL
- [ ] Check that all jet bridges are assigned to gates 
- [ ] Verify that the jet bridge is assigned only to the gates that it is to service (i.e. not assigned to gates on the other side of the terminal)
- [ ] Jet bridges are positioned in a way that would be "stowed" by adjusting height, extension and rotation
- [ ] Ensure jet bridge reach (green arc) covers the gate and all doors for all available aircraft (partial coverage is not acceptable - use the "Rotate Range +90" button if required)
- [ ] "Jet Bridges Available" tick box selected (orange tick when selected) by tapping "File > Airport Properties > Jet Bridges Available"
