# 11A.1 Overview



### 11A.1.1

The purpose of the Reviewer Team is to:

- assist in the day-to-day operations of the Scenery Editing Team
- provide leadership and/or mentoring to individual Editors
- assign airports to Editors with the rank of Apprentice 
- review editing quality via the "Official Review" process
- and moderate the Scenery Editing Team Discord channel



To carry this out, Reviewers will be added to the following channel within Discord:

| Channel        | Purpose                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| #information   | This channel is used by Staff and Airport Moderators only to make announcements. Reviewers **must not**{.red} reply to any material posted in this channel so that all Reviewers can be reached effectively |
| #reviewers     | This channel is used to facilitate communications between all Reviewers for any purpose deemed necessary |
| #review-status | This channel is used to post progress on an airport review (including when it is started, finished, and when the changes are made and subsequently re-reviewed) |
| #review-help   | This channel is used to ask for help or ask questions about the airport being reviewed |



### 11A.1.2

Reviewers are selected by the Airport Moderators based on a number of criteria, including, but not limited to:



- current standing within the Scenery Editing Team
- contributions to the Scenery Editing Team
- operational necessity
- and/or the ability to assist in internal team affairs within a professional context



> Reviewers may be demoted or removed from the Reviewer Team for any reason as deemed by the Airport Moderators (e.g. breach of trust, abuse of power, lack of commitment etc.)
