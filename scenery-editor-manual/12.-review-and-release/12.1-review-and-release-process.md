# 12.1 Review and Release Process



> When uploading a new version of a recently edited airport (i.e tapping "Upload as Draft" or "Upload for Review"), Editors will be required to submit a "changelog" which highlights what has been changed in that version. Changelogs **must**{.red} be specific to ensure that it is clear what has been changed (e.g. "Adjusted C19 jetbridge. Changed taxiway line type on Taxiway A"). Additional details can be added to the IFC airport thread if required 



### 12.1.1

In order to have your airport published in Infinite Flight, you **must**{.red} submit your airport for review so it can be checked for compliance with all rules defined in this manual. To assist with Reviewer workload a two stage review process is available as shown below:



| Review Type | Description                                                  | Who can Review    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Peer        | A voluntary step in the review process that **should**{.red} be done in order to get feedback from fellow Editors | Editor or above   |
| Official    | A mandatory review in which the airport **must**{.red} be submitted before it will be included in a release cycle | Reviewer or above |



### 12.1.2

Before submitting for a review, a Scenery Check **must**{.red} be completed to ensure that the airport is compliant with the limits put in place (i.e. performance limitations, objects outside the boundary, naming issues/duplicates of gates etc.):



Step 1

: Tap "File > Scenery Stats > Scenery Check > Check Scenery"



Step 2

: Any errors listed can then be found by tapping on an error and then "Select Items"



Step 3

: You will then be able to see the selected item on the airport and decide if it needs to be changed



## Peer Review 

### 12.1.3

Tip

: In order to upload your airport as a draft or for review, changes have to be made since the last uploaded version (this can be as minor as moving a cone)



Step 1

: Once an airport is completed, it **must**{.red} be uploaded using "File > File Manager > Upload as Draft" *(see [2.1.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.2) above)*. It can then be submitted for a "peer" review by posting a link to the IFC airport thread in the *#request-peer-review* Discord channel



> Editors conducting Peer Reviews **must not**{.red} take more than 2 airports at any time, and **must**{.red} ensure that they have the time available to conduct the review in a timely manner (i.e. time frames of when the review will be done **must not**{.red} be mentioned as the Editor is expected to only conduct a Peer Review when they are available). If in doubt, the Editor **should**{.red} leave the airport available for review *(see [1A.3.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/1a.-administration/1a.3-editor-rules#1a.3.1) above)*



Step 2

: Once feedback is received, the Editor can then work on these changes before either re-submitting for another peer review, or for an official review. All feedback related to a review (both peer and official) **must**{.red} be conducted in the IFC airport thread to ensure a record is kept



> There is no limit on how many Peer Reviews can be given per airport, however Editors **should**{.red} only submit their airport for review when they believe it is complete. If help or guidance is needed before an airport is complete, Editors **should**{.red} utilize the *#help* Discord channel to ask specific questions related to their airport



## Official Review

### 12.1.4

Tip

: In order to upload your airport as a draft or for review, changes have to be made since the last uploaded version (this can be as minor as moving a cone)



Step 1

: When the Editor is ready to submit for an "official" review, they can do this by using "File > File Manager > Upload for Review" *(see [2.1.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.2) above)*



Step 2

: Feedback will be given by a Reviewer in the IFC airport thread. If additional changes are required, these **must**{.red} be resubmitted following the same process as outlined above. Feedback provided by reviewers is mandatory. If a change is requested, it **must**{.red} be implemented for the airport to be considered ready for release.



Step 3

: Once the airport is considered ready by the Reviewer, the airport will be marked as "Ready for Release" and will be included in a release cycle at some point



> Once your airport is "Ready for Release" it will not necessarily be released in the next cycle. This is because other factors also determine what is or isn't included in the release, more information can be found [here](https://community.infiniteflight.com/t/airport-releases/653276)



## Navigation Database Update

### 12.1.5

Following an airport being approved and marked as ready for release, some changes may only be visible in-app after the next navigation database update is completed. This is usually at the same time as a release. This applies to:



- airport boundary
- airport elevation
- airport mini-map
- runway information (such as approach types)
- start locations
- tower view point



> e.g. when the airport boundary is changed, the elevation within this new section will only match the rest of the airport elevation after the navigation database update. This may mean that there will be floating or submerged buildings/objects in this new area
