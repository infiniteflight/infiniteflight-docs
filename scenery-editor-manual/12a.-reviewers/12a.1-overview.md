# 12A.1 Overview



### 12A.1.1

The purpose of the Reviewer Team is to:

- Assist in the day-to-day operations of the Scenery Editing Team
- Provide leadership and/or mentoring to individual Editors
- Assign airports to Editors with the rank of Apprentice 
- Review editing quality via the "Official Review" process*
- and Moderate the Scenery Editing Team Discord channel



**Reviewers **should not**{.red} upload changes on behalf of the editors during the Official Review process without the editors' explicit consent in the interest of the editors' skill improvement and respect towards the editors' work, unless the issues found during the Official Review process are minor, not consistently present, and a new OR cycle for the airport would not be considered reasonable if they were left for the airport's editor to fix. Examples of minor issues are improperly snapped lines, buildings and/or pavements, and lines with 1 or more inaccurate properties. Reviewers are advised to use their judgement regarding the consistency and severity of the issues found proportionally to the size and complexity of the airport subject to review. For example, 3 improperly snapped lines would not be as big of an issue at KLAX, but they would be at a small GA field. If a Reviewer does decide to upload changes on behalf of the editors during the Official Review process, a summary of the changes made, preferably including screenshots, **should**{.red} be provided for the sake of respect towards the editors' work.*



To carry this out, Reviewers will be added to the following channel within Discord:

| Channel           | Purpose                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| #information      | Day to day posts (such as housekeeping) to be made in this channel by Staff and Moderators only |
| #reviewers        | This channel is used to facilitate communications between all Reviewers for any purpose deemed necessary |
| #review-status    | This channel is used to post progress on an airport review (including when it is started, finished, and when the changes are made and subsequently re-reviewed) |
| #review-help      | This channel is used to ask for help or ask questions about the airport being reviewed |
| #role-assignments | This channel is used by Airport Moderators and Reviewers to assign and unassign themselves from notifications when a new ticket is created in #help-request *(see [1A.1.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/1a.-administration/1a.1-discord-communication#1A.1.2) above)* |
| #navigation       | This channel is used to track changes made to Infinite Flight's ILS source file, located in a separate GitHub repository |



### 12A.1.2

Reviewers are selected by the Airport Moderators based on a number of criteria, including, but not limited to:



- current standing within the Scenery Editing Team
- contributions to the Scenery Editing Team
- operational necessity
- and/or the ability to assist in internal team affairs within a professional context



> Reviewers may be demoted or removed from the Reviewer Team for any reason as deemed by the Airport Moderators (e.g. breach of trust, abuse of power, lack of commitment etc.)



### 12A.1.3

Reviewers **must not**{.red} make any amendments to an airport that has been submitted for review under the Official Review process. Feedback must be provided to the Editor so that they can make the changes required *(see [12.1.4](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/12.-review-and-release/12.1-review-and-release-process#12.1.4) above)*.



> It is acceptable to make very small amendments to an airport under the Official Review process if the Reviewer does not deem it necessary to highlight this as feedback to the Editor
