## How to Pick an Airport to Review



### 12A.1.1

The following procedure outlines how to pick an airport that is awaiting review:



Step 1

: Go to the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.infiniteflight.com) and login using your IFC credentials (if required, login is normally automatic)



Step 2

: From the navigation bar on the left of the screen, select "Airports" under "Scenery Editing"



Step 3

: Select "Waiting for Review" from the top navigation bar 



Step 4

: Select the airport you wish to review by tapping on the three dots on the right of the airport and then change the status of the airport by tapping "Mark as In Review"



> Airports are ordered with the oldest airport first. Reviewers **should**{.red} always select the oldest airport in the queue when choosing an airport to review (if in doubt, Reviewers **must**{.red} raise this with fellow Reviewers and Airport Moderators). The only exceptions to this are when:
>
> - the Reviewer has limited time available, and there is a smaller airport that could be reviewed within that timeframe, or;
> - an airport has been resubmitted for review following only minor changes that could quickly be re-reviewed by the same Reviewer



## How to Review an Airport



### 12A.1.2

The following procedure outlines the order in which to follow when reviewing an airport:



Step 1

: Once the airport has been selected, tap the three dots on the right and then "View on Forum". This will open the current topic for that airport in a new tab. Reviewers **must**{.red} ensure that they look at the history (i.e. if any previous reviews have been undertaken by another reviewer) of the airport before starting their review 



> If a Reviewer is unsure about previous feedback, they **should**{.red} contact the previous Reviewer to seek clarification to ensure all feedback is consistent



Step 2

: Reviewers can then conduct a full review of the airport, taking into account any previous history of the airport to ensure it is compliant with the standards set out within this manual *(see [12.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/12.-review-and-release/12.2-editor-checklist#12.2-editor-checklist) above)*



Step 3

: Feedback **must**{.red} be given in the IFC airport thread so that there is a record of this



Step 4

: Following the review, return to the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.infiniteflight.com) and login using your IFC credentials



Step 5

: From the navigation bar on the left of the screen, select "Airports" under "Scenery Editing"



Step 6

: Select "In Review" from the top navigation bar



Step 7

: Select the airport in review by tapping on the three dots on the right of the airport and then change the status of the airport as required (i.e. "Needs Changes" or "Ready for Release")



> All airports marked as "Ready for Release" will be included in the next update of the app; therefore, Reviewers **must**{.red} ensure that there is no doubt in the airports quality



## How to Assign an Airport to an Apprentice



### 12A.1.3

The following procedure outlines how to assign an airport to an Apprentice:



> In some cases, Editors may also require manual assignment to an airport (e.g. if the airport has been previously assigned to another Editor). In these cases (typically collaborations with multiple Editors of the same airport), the below procedure can be followed



Step 1

: Go to the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.infiniteflight.com) and login using your IFC credentials



Step 2

: From the navigation bar on the left of the screen, select "Editors" under "Scenery Editing"



Step 3

: Select "Apprentices" from the top navigation bar



Step 4

: Use the search function to locate the Editor. Tap the three dots on the right and then "Manage Assignments"



Step 5

: Type the ICAO airport code in the search bar and then "Update"



> Apprentices **must not**{.red} be assigned more than one airport at a time, unless the airport has been submitted for an Official Review. Apprentices may be assigned (and begin editing) their next airport whilst awaiting feedback from their airport in review, but **must**{.red} prioritize completing this airport once feedback has been given



## How to Promote an Apprentice to Editor



### 12A.1.4

The following procedure outlines how to promote an Apprentice to the rank of Editor:



> All Apprentices **must**{.red} complete a minimum of two airports (i.e. submitted for Official Review and have been marked as Ready for Release) before being promoted to Editor. After this, it is the sole discretion of Reviewers to determine when to promote an Apprentice. It is important to note that once they have been promoted, they will no longer require assignment when choosing new airports to edit. Reviewers **should**{.red} take this into account along with previous feedback, Apprentice reception to feedback, and overall judgement before promoting them. Reviewers **must**.{red} consider the opinions of fellow Reviewers before promoting an Apprentice Editor.



Step 1

: Go to the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.infiniteflight.com) and login using your IFC credentials



Step 2

: From the navigation bar on the left of the screen, select "Editors" under "Scenery Editing"



Step 3

: Select "Apprentices" from the top navigation bar



Step 4

: Use the search function to locate the Editor. Tap the three dots on the right and then "Promote from Apprentice"
