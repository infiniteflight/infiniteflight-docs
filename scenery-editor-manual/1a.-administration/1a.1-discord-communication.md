## General

### 1A.1.1

## Voice Channels

### 1A.1.3

Voice Channels (VCs) **must**{.red} only be used in accordance with the Discord Rules *(see [1A.2.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/1a.-administration/1a.2-discord-rules#1a.2.1) below)*. 



### 1A.1.4

The use of VCs is **not required**{.red} and is at the sole discretion of the Editors. 

It is important to note that all pro subscribers have access to the voice channels, so only use these channels if you are comfortable with your airport progress being made public (If non editors join the voice channel)


### 1A.1.5

To open a VC, the following steps are to be followed:



Step 1

: Open the Official Infinite Flight Discord



Step 2

: Navigate to the Voice Chat category

Step 3

: Create voice chat



**Coordination with other Editors **should**{.red} be done in the respective Discord channel (i.e. *#editors-chat*) before entering a VC*



### 1A.1.6

Below are some useful tips for VCs:

- You can see how many members currently occupy a VC at any time by noting the [00/10] channel count
- Selecting "Mute" (microphone symbol) means no one can hear you
- Selecting "Deafen" (headphones symbol) means you don't hear anyone else
- Always double-check your sound settings (i.e. Input = Mic and Output = Speaker)
- Connecting to a VC will act much like a phone call and can run in the background whilst editing
