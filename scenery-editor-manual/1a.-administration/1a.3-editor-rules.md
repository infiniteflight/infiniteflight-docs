# 1A.3  Editor Rules



### 1A.3.1

- All Editors **should not**{.red} edit airports that are closed IRL
- Editors conducting Peer Reviews **must not**{.red} take more than 2 airports at any time, and **must**{.red} ensure that they have the time available to conduct the review in a timely manner (i.e. time frames of when the review will be done **must not**{.red} be mentioned as the Editor is expected to only conduct a Peer Review when they are available). If in doubt, the Editor **should**{.red} leave the airport available for review *(see [12.1.3](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/12.-review-and-release/12.1-review-and-release-process#12.1.3) below)*
- Editors **must not**{.red} "leak" any WIP airports that they are not editing themselves without the express permission of the assigned Editor(s). Doing so may result in removal of the editor from the Airport Editing Team *(see [1A.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/1a.6-disciplinary-and-suspension-procedure) below)*
- When uploading a new version of a recently edited airport (i.e tapping "Upload as Draft" or "Upload for Review"), Editors will be required to submit a "changelog" which highlights what has been changed in that version. Changelogs **must**{.red} be specific to ensure that it is clear what has been changed (e.g. "Adjusted C19 jetbridge. Changed taxiway line type on Taxiway A"). Additional details can be added to the IFC airport thread if required *(see [12.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/12.-review-and-release/12.1-review-and-release-process) below)*
