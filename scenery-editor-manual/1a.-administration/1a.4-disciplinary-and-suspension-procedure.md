# 1A.4  Disciplinary and Suspension Procedure

 

### 1A.4.1    

Editors not following the Scenery Editing Manual can expect the following procedure:

 

| Offense | Action Taken                              |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1st     | Warning via DM                            |
| 2nd     | 3 day Scenery Editor & Discord suspension |
| 3rd     | 7 day Scenery Editor & Discord suspension |
| 4th     | Removal from the Airport Editing Team     |

Following any suspension, Editors will return at the rank they previously held. Usually the date they’re reinstated on will serve as the new start date at that rank, however this is dealt with on a case by case basis.



### 1A.4.2

Serious cases, reviewed by Staff or IFC Moderators, are subject to immediate removal or suspension.
