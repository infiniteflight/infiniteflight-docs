# 1A.5  Airport Assignments



### 1A.5.1    

All Editors at the rank of Apprentice (initial rank when joining) **must**{.red} have all airports assigned to them in order to upload them. This is to ensure that new Editors do not assign themselves an airport too large/complex and so that they can focus on one airport at a time, addressing any issues spotted during Peer and Official Reviews *(see [12.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/12.-review-and-release/12.1-review-and-release-process) below)*.



> Apprentices **must not**{.red} be assigned more than one airport at a time, unless the airport has been submitted for an Official Review. Apprentices may be assigned (and begin editing) their next airport whilst awaiting feedback from their airport in review, but **must**{.red} prioritize completing this airport once feedback has been given



### 1A.5.2

Following successful Official Reviews from airports that have been assigned, Apprentices will be promoted to the rank of Editor and will no longer be required to request airport assignments *(see [1A.4.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/1a.-administration/1a.4-rank-structure#1a.4.2) above)*.



> In some cases, Editors may also require manual intervention by a Reviewer. For example, to get unassigned from an airport, to collaborate and work on an airport with other Editors at the same time, or if the airport has been previously assigned to another Editor. In these cases, it remains the discretion of the Reviewing Team and may not be approved (even if the Editor has already been promoted from the rank of Apprentice)



### 1A.5.3

For any request relating to airport assignments the following steps **must**{.red} be followed:



Step 1

: Open the Offical Infinite Flight Discord and using the navigation bar on the left side of the screen, find the "Scenery Editing" tab



Step 2

: Click on the *#airport-assignments* Discord channel



Step 3

: Create a request in the channel for an airport you'd like to edit. The following format must be used to request airports: "Requesting ICAO" and any other information that may be relevant such as "collab with [editors name]"



Step 4

: A Reviewer will look at the request and either approve the airport assignment or suggest an alternative plan (for Apprentices in particular, this may be the case if the airport is considered too large/complex)



> This will be in a thread underneath the request made. All further comments relating to that airport **should**{.red} be in the thread to ensure that airport assignments are not lost within the Discord channel



### 1A.5.4

When Apprentices select an airport that they want to be assigned, consideration **should**{.red} be given to the following criteria:



- Airport size and complexity
- Time available
- Ability
- and Previous feedback given by Reviewers (if applicable)
