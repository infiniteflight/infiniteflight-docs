# 1A.6  Disciplinary and Suspension Procedure

 

### 1A.6.1    

Editors not following the Scenery Editing Manual can expect the following procedure:

 

| Offense | Action Taken                              |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1st     | Warning via DM                            |
| 2nd     | 3 day Scenery Editor & Discord suspension |
| 3rd     | 7 day Scenery Editor & Discord suspension |
| 4th     | Removal from the Airport Editing Team     |

Following any suspension, Editors will return at the rank they previously held. Usually, the date theyâ€™re reinstated on will serve as the new start date at that rank; however, this is dealt with on a case by case basis.



### 1A.6.2

Serious cases, reviewed by Staff or IFC Moderators, are subject to immediate removal or suspension.
