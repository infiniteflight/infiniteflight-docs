# 2.1 Editor Screen



### 2.1.1

![Image 2.1.1.1 - Scenery Editor Screen](_images/manual/scenery-editor/user-interface/editor-screen.png)



1. The management buttons allow you to manage files, edit recent activity, change the view, adjust object altitude, add/change pavements/taxiways/buildings and import satellite imagery *(see [2.1.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.2) below)*

   

2. "Last saved" information is displayed for the current editing session only. If a new editing session is started (even if you remain in-app), it will reset the "Last Saved" on the bottom bar to "N/A" until the session is saved

   

3. The main navigation bar contains the library of objects, properties and loaded items *(see [2.1.3](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.3) below)*

   

4. The edit buttons allow you to move, copy & paste, edit or delete selected buildings, objects and taxiways *(see [2.1.4](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.4) below)*

   

5. The camera in use can be changed here *(see [2.1.5](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.5) below)*

   

6. Time, ending current session and adjusting settings can be changed here (more information on settings can be found in the [Getting Started Guide](https://infiniteflight.com/guide/getting-started-guide/home-user-interface/settings))




## Management Buttons

### 2.1.2

+++ File

| Button                  | Function                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Save Selected as Bundle | Select a group of buildings and/or objects and then tap this button to save them as a bundle for future use to speed up editing times |
| Share Selected Bundle   | When a bundle is selected from the library, this can be shared with other Editors using this button |
| Download OSM            | By tapping this button, the Open Street Map data will be downloaded which will usually provide most of the buildings within (and close to) the airport boundaries |
| Download OSM at Cursor  | If buildings are missing or you accidentally delete some, you can download the OSM data at the cursor point with this button (it has an approximate range of 200 meters) |
| Scenery Stats           | This shows key stats about the objects currently placed including poly count. It also contains the "Scenery Checker" which will ensure that your airport is compliant with the limits put in place (i.e. performance limitations, objects outside the boundary, naming issues/duplicates of gates etc. - *see [12.1.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/12.-review-and-release/12.1-review-and-release-process#11.1.2) below*) |
| Save                    | Saves the latest changes locally to your device. *Note: The autosave function will automatically save once every minute to ensure work is not lost* |
| File Manager            | This will show when it was last modified locally, options for upload, restoring backups and exporting *(see table below)*. *Note: Airports will only be uploaded to the server when "upload complete" is shown. Downloading a version from the server will override your local device version* |
| Airport Properties      | General details of the airport can be changed including the ICAO code, elevation, name, airport class and frequencies |



**File Manager:**

If it is a new airport, after the initial upload you will be assigned the airport to ensure that no one else can override your work at that airport.

| File Manager          | What it does                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Local                 | Last modified locally (on your device)                       |
| Online                | If changes have been made, this will indicate that the local changes are ready for upload |
| Upload as Draft*      | This will save your work online (recommended to do this regularly to have a copy stored online in case there are any app issues causing you to lose your recent edits) - this is also required for peer reviews as other Editors will then be able to view your work so far |
| Upload for Review*    | When your airport is complete, you can submit it for an official review |
| Revert to last Upload | If you want to go back to the last upload, this will undo any work done |
| Backups               | A backup can be selected by tapping on it (turns amber to show it is selected) and then "Restore" |
| Restore               | Will revert to the previous version that is selected within the backup list |
| Delete All Local      | The files will autosave at intervals but this can build up and there may be too many local files. This button clears your cache |
| Export                | This will export the file from the Scenery Editor and into your chosen location such as a Google Drive (not required) |
| Close                 | Closes the file manager                                      |



**When uploading a new version of a recently edited airport (i.e tapping "Upload as Draft" or "Upload for Review"), Editors will be required to submit a "changelog" which highlights what has been changed in that version. Changelogs **must**{.red} be specific to ensure that it is clear what has been changed (e.g. "Adjusted C19 jetbridge. Changed taxiway line type on Taxiway A"). Additional details can be added to the IFC airport thread if required *(see [12.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/12.-review-and-release/12.1-review-and-release-process) below)**

## Navigation Bar

### 2.1.3

+++ Library

This contains a repository of all available objects that can be used. How to add objects can be found later in this manual *(see [10.2.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/10.-objects/10.2-selection-and-placement#10.2.2) below)*

+++



+++ Properties

The properties tab will vary based on whether buildings, objects, start positions, lines, pavements or jet bridges are selected. They can all be changed from within this tab.

+++



+++ Items

This shows a list of all buildings, lines, pavements and objects that are currently loaded at the airport. You can scroll up/down using your finger.



> Tapping on an item within the list will select the object and show the "changing orientation" movement symbols to make it easy to identify at your airport *(see [10.2.3](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/10.-objects/10.2-selection-and-placement#10.2.3) below)*

## Edit Buttons

### 2.1.4



+++ Edit

| Button                                | Function                                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Create Hole                           | With a section of pavement selected, this button will allow holes to be created within a block of pavement *(see [6.1.5](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/6.-pavements/6.1-editing-pavements#6.1.5) below)* |
| Line Options               | Tapping on this will show to following options: <br><br> **Simplify** - This will reduce the number of nodes required to form a line, useful for reducing nodes on taxiway curves with excessive nodes<br><br> **Reverse** - All points are numbered, this button will reverse the numbering of all points (this can also be used for buildings that are "inside out")<br><br>**Straighten** - Select a series of points and then tap this button to straighten the line between all points selected|
| Split Line                            | Select a line, and then a point within that line. You can then tap "Split Line" to split it into two separate lines (particularly useful for naming different taxiways that are currently all one line). The line after the point where the split was made will remain selected |
| Snap Off / Snap to All / Snap to Type | Snapping allows the Editor to "attach" a point to another point/line to avoid gaps and/or overlapping. Snapping **must**{.red} be used to connect buildings/lines/pavements. When "Snap Off" is selected, you will be unable to snap. When "Snap to All" is selected, it allows you to snap buildings/lines/pavements to each other. "Snap to Type" works the same but is only to the same type (e.g. line to line etc.) |
| Insert Point                          | This will insert a point with any building or pavement that is selected. This point will be added sequentially (i.e. after the last numbered point) unless a point within the line is selected, in which case a new point is created between this point and the next point |
| Adding/Selecting Point(s)             | Tap this button to cycle between "Adding" and "Selecting". Adding Points will add a point between two points if the line/edge between them is tapped, or after the last numbered point if you tap anywhere else. Selecting Points will allow you to select a point (although you can still do this with "Adding Points" selected) |
| Modify Shape                          | This **must**{.red} be tapped (amber when selected) to allow you to modify the shape of any building, taxiway point or pavement. When not selected you will only be able to move the entire shape rather than individual points |
| Delete Selection                      | This button will delete the select buildings and objects     |

## Camera

### 2.1.5

Tip

: Currently it is recommended to use the "Airport/Scen Editor" and "Birds Eye View" cameras when editing, however the "Free" camera is particularly useful for positioning the ATC Tower



@[vimeo](558260851)



## Rectangle Selection Tool

### 2.1.6

To select multiple buildings/lines/pavements or objects you can use the rectangle selection tool:



Step 1

: Tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to select (a white box will appear to show the catchment area)



Step 2

: Once the white box contains what you want to select, release and they will be selected 



## In-App Ruler

### 2.1.7

To use the ruler, follow the steps below:



Step 1

: Place two fingers on your device's screen and hold



Step 2

: A rule will appear (both fingers must remain on the screen whilst using the ruler)



Step 3

: The ruler can then be used to measure by sliding your two fingers on the screen. It will provide measurements in meters, feet and nautical miles as well as bearing information 



Tip

: Make sure to have on screen what you would like to measure (the ruler will disappear if you try to move the camera)



Step 4

: When you are finished with the ruler, simply remove your fingers from the screen



Tip

: The ruler is only accurate on the ground
