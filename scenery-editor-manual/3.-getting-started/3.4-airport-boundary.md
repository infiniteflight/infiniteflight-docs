# 3.4 Airport Boundary



### 3.4.1

The airport boundary is shown in a light green line that surrounds the airport, the elevation within the airport boundary will always be completely flat to allow editing and prevent any buildings/objects from floating or being submerged. All topography outside of the airport boundary will have a varying elevation based on real world topography.



Tip

: If you find buildings/objects are floating/submerged, it may be because they are too close to the airport boundary, you can either move the airport boundary or move the buildings/objects slightly in from the boundary



### 3.4.2

To edit the airport boundary, follow the steps below:



> Note: if changing the airport boundary, a navigation database update will be required before the new boundary is reflected in-app. Therefore Editors **should**{.red} avoid adding any new buildings/objects in the new airport boundary until this has been updated



Step 1

: Tap on or near to the light green line and select "airport boundary" **(1)**



> You might not be presented with the option to select "airport boundary" but you will know if it is selected by looking at the bottom left of the screen where it will indicate what is currently selected



Step 2

: Tap "Modify Shape" from the edit buttons on the right **(2)**, it will turn amber to show it has been selected



Step 3

Step 4

: Tap, hold and drag on the center circle to move the node **(4)**
