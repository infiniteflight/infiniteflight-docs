# 4.1 Satellite



## Overview

### 4.1.1

Satellite imagery is used to assist Editors in creating accurate airports. SASPlanet is the recommended program, as it is capable of exporting orthophotos from various sources, such as Google, Bing or Yandex maps in varying quality. Files downloaded will be zipped, which can be extracted using Windows Explorer. A link to download this program is below:



> SASPlanet is only available on Windows and Linux. MacOS users will need to request orthophotos from other Editors

Tip

: Satellite imagery can be distorted, it is important to remember this while editing. Straight lines may appear warped, your best judgement should be used in these cases to avoid unrealistic bends or curves

## Zoom Levels

### 4.1.3

Different zoom levels are available:

| Zoom Level (z) | Quality    | Notes                                                        |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

| z21            | High       | Maximum quality that can be found from public sources        |
| z20            | Good       | z20 or higher **should**{.red} always be used when available |
| z19            | Marginal   | If higher quality not available, can be sufficient           |
| z18 or lower   | Poor       | z18 or lower **should not**{.red} be used                    |



### 4.1.4

To work out if the zoom level required is available:



Step 1

: Click the "Cached tiles map" icon (this is 5 icons in from the left of the screen and represented by a silver/black circle) and then tick the relevant zoom



Step 2

: If the tiles are clear, then the zoom level is available. Otherwise, they will be shown in grey



Tip

: You can check different satellite image sources to find the most recent images or images of best quality, however, construction sites, outdated imagery and low image quality can make editing quite hard, especially for a new Editor. If your desired airport has low quality imagery and/or significant construction sites impeding editing in SAS, consider postponing the airport to a later date until more recent or higher quality imagery is available
