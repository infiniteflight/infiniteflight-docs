# 5.2 Properties



### 5.2.1

Step 1

: Select the runway by tapping on or near the runway *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 2

: You may have to select the runway from a drop down box if there are multiple in close proximity. The runway name will appear to indicate it has been selected



Step 3

: Tap the "Properties" tab on the right side of the screen



Step 4

: You can then adjust the following properties for the runway

| Button | Function | Notes |
| ------ | -------- | ----- |
| Runway | Runway properties, such as markings and lights | See [5.2.2](#5.2.2) below |
| Latitude / Longitude | Coordinates of the runway | **Should not**{.red} be changed, it does not move the runway itself | 
| Altitude | This shows the current altitude (in meters) of the start location. *(Inherited from the airport's elevation - see [3.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/3.-getting-started/3.2-airport-properties#3.2.2))* | **Should not**{.red} be changed |
| Name | You can name the runway using this field | Correct format: "*(Lower RWY end ID)*[L/R/C/T]-*(Higher RWY end ID)*[L/R/C/T]". L/R/C/T are optional, they **must only**{.red} be added if the runway identifier has one of these IRL. Examples: 09-27, 08R-26L, 18C-36C, 03T-21T| 



### 5.2.2

| Button | Function | Notes |
| ------ | -------- | ----- |
| Width | You can change the width of the runway (in meters) | |
| Surface | You can change the surface type by tapping this | Surface types **must**{.red} be chosen based on airport documentation, rather than what is seen on satellite imagery (i.e. even if a bright asphalt runways looks like concrete color-wise, it **must**{.red} still be drawn as asphalt) |
| ShoulderSurface | You can change the runway shoulder surface type (concrete or asphalt) | Surface types **must**{.red} be chosen based on airport documentation, rather than what is seen on satellite imagery (i.e. even if a bright asphalt runways looks like concrete color-wise, it **must**{.red} still be drawn as asphalt) |
| HasEdgeLights | You can change whether or not the runway has edge lights | **Must**{.red} be set in accordance with airport documentation |
| HasCenterlineLights | You can change whether or not the runwyay has centerline lights | **Must**{.red} be set in accordance with airport documentation |
| RunwayEnds | Runway end properties | See [5.2.3](#5.2.3) below |
| Length | Shows the runway length (in meters) | Cannot be changed through the Properties window. Calculated based on the distance between the two nodes |



### 5.2.3

The RunwayEnds property contains two runway end groups. Their structure is identical; properties in these can differ.

| Button | Function | Notes |
| ------ | -------- | ----- |
| Overrun | You can change the runway overrun area (in meters) | |
| DisplacedThreshold | You can change how much the runway threshold is dispalced (in meters) | |
| Approach Lights | You can change the approach lights | Approach lights **must**{.red} be set in accordance with airport documentation |
| Markings | You can change the markings type of the runway | |
| Touchdown Lighting | You can change whether or not the runway end has touchdown lighting | Currently unavailable in Infinite Flight. Touchdown lighting **must**{.red} be set in accordance with airport documentation for futureproofing purposes. |
| REILType | You can change the Runway End Identifier Lights type | REIL lights **must**{.red} be set in accordance with airport documentation |
| Location | Coordinates of the runway end | **Should not**{.red} be changed |
| Identifier | You can change the runway end identifier[^1] | Correct format: "*(RWY ID)*[L/R/C/T]. L/R/C/T are optional, they **must only**{.red} be added if the runway identifier has one of these IRL. |
| Glideslope / Localizer | *N/A*[^2] | **Must not**{.red} be set |
| Heading | Changes the runway end heading | **Should not**{.red} be changed through the Properties window, move the runway nodes instead *(see [5.1.2](#5.2.1) above)* |



> [^1] In case a runway identifier for an ILS end of a runway has been modified, open a Reviewer ticket in the IFAET Discord server, and notify them of the runway end identifier change.



> [^2] In case a runway has missing ILS, open a Reviewer ticket in the IFAET Discord server, and notify them of the missing ILS for the respective runway.
