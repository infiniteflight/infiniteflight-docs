# 6.1 Editing Pavements



+++ Do and Do Not

| :fa-check-circle: DO                                         | :fa-times-circle: DO NOT                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| :fa-check-circle: Add roads and taxiways as shown in charts and satellite imagery | :fa-times-circle: Add public roads which are invisible or irrelevant for pilots using the airport |
| :fa-check-circle: Add grass taxiways where they are used for aircraft movements | :fa-times-circle: Add grass taxiways to replicate pieces of lawn which are not used as movement areas |
| :fa-check-circle: Add public roads in areas which are prominently visible from aircraft movement areas | :fa-times-circle: Add concrete or snow pavements to replicate bright asphalt areas |
| :fa-check-circle: Add concrete pavement below hangar buildings (other materials are allowed if this is present IRL) | :fa-times-circle: Create pavement areas using lots of small segments unnecessarily |
| :fa-check-circle: Keep the number of connecting nodes between taxiway pieces to a minimum | :fa-times-circle: Add snow pavements to create texts or symbols on the ground |
| :fa-check-circle: Add pavement patches on top of the surrounding pavements (i.e. no hole created underneath)* | :fa-times-circle: Add any types of “easter eggs”             |
| - | :fa-times-circle: Use too many nodes for edges |
| - | :fa-times-circle: Recreate broken pavements |

**If there is a more performance efficient way (i.e. less nodes created) then this is acceptable (at the Reviewers discretion). E.g. snapping a pavement patch to the edge of the pavement rather than placing it on top, or allowing holes to be created underneath*

Tip

: Whenever you connect buildings/lines/pavements, you **must**{.red} use the "Snap" function to avoid gaps and/or overlapping *(see [2.1.4](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.4) above)*  



## Creating Pavements

### 6.1.1

Step 1

: Tap "Pavement" and then "Create Pavement" **(1)** from the management buttons on the left



Step 2

: Tap in the area of the airport that you want pavement **(2)**, the first node will be placed



Step 3

: Continue to tap to add nodes **(3)**, once three or more are placed, a section of pavement will be created

Tip

: Use the walls of a shipping container to help make 90 degree corners

## Editing an Existing Pavements Shape

### 6.1.2

Step 1

: Select the pavement by tapping on or near the pavement, you may have to select the pavement from a drop down list if there are multiple items in the vicinity *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 2

: Tap the "Modify Shape" button on the right side **(1)**



Step 3

: The outline will turn magenta when selected and nodes will appear



Step 4

: By tapping a node it will turn magenta **(2)** to show it has been selected *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 5

: You can then tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to move the node(s) into the desired position



Step 6

: When editing is complete, tap "Modify Shape" to deselect it (you will be unable to edit other pavements without doing this)

## Moving/Changing Orientation of Pavement

### 6.1.3

Step 1

: Select the pavement by tapping on or near the pavement *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 2

: You may have to select the pavement from a drop down box if there are multiple in close proximity. The outline of the pavement will turn magenta to indicate it has been selected **(1)**



Tip

: If you have only just made the pavement then just tap "Modify Shape" to deselect this and the pavement will be selected



Step 3

: Two circles will appear as well as a compass rose. Tap and hold on the circle **(2)** to move the pavement or to change orientation:



| Circle | Function                                                     |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Center | Will move the pavement by dragging your finger to the desired location |
| Outer  | Will change the orientation of the pavement by dragging your finger in the direction you want to orientate it to |

: Continue to tap to add nodes **(5)**, once three or more are placed, a hole will be created and you can continue to add more nodes to create the desired shape
