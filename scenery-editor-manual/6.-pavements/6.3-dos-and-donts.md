# 6.3 Pavements Dos and Don'ts

Below is a table containing what you do need to edit and what you do not edit, while working with pavements

| :fa-check-circle: DO                                         | :fa-times-circle: DO NOT                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| :fa-check-circle: Add roads and taxiways as shown in charts and satellite imagery | :fa-times-circle: Add public roads which are invisible or irrelevant for pilots using the airport |
| :fa-check-circle: Add grass pavement where they are used for aircraft movements | :fa-times-circle: Add grass pavement to replicate pieces of lawn which are not used as movement areas |
| :fa-check-circle: Add public roads in areas which are prominently visible from aircraft movement areas | :fa-times-circle: Add concrete or snow pavements to replicate bright asphalt areas |
| :fa-check-circle: Add concrete pavement below hangar buildings (other materials are allowed if this is present IRL) | :fa-times-circle: Create pavement areas using lots of small segments unnecessarily |
| :fa-check-circle: Keep the number of connecting nodes between taxiway pieces to a minimum | :fa-times-circle: Add snow pavements to create texts or symbols on the ground |
| :fa-check-circle: Add pavement patches on top of the surrounding pavements (i.e. no hole created underneath)* | :fa-times-circle: Add any types of “easter eggs”             |
| - | :fa-times-circle: Use too many nodes for edges |
| - | :fa-times-circle: Recreate broken pavements |

**If there is a more performance efficient way (i.e. less nodes created) then this is acceptable (at the Reviewers discretion). E.g. snapping a pavement patch to the edge of the pavement rather than placing it on top, or allowing holes to be created underneath*
