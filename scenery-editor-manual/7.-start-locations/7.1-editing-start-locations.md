# 7.1 Editing Start Locations



> If adding/moving start locations, a navigation database update will be required before the new start locations are reflected in-app



## How to see Aircraft Start Locations 

### 7.1.1

Before placing objects near aircraft start locations, it is recommended to turn on Aircraft Start Locations following these steps:



Step 1

: On the left of the screen, tap "View"



Step 2

: Then tap "Start Locations" (it will change to amber to indicate it has been selected)



Step 3

: Each start location will be represented by a blue dot. By zooming in on a start location you will be able to see the start location details including:

- Identifier (i.e. Terminal and stand number)
- Type (i.e. Gate, Tie-down, Misc or Hangar)
- Gate Size (i.e. maximum aircraft category)
- Ramp Operation Type (i.e. GA, Airline, Cargo or Military)



## Selecting and Placing a Start Location

### 7.1.2

Step 1

: Scroll up/down the list on the right of the screen to see the object repository (the "Library" tab **must**{.red} be selected)



Step 2

: Select "Start Location" under "Airport Items" by tapping it **(1)**



Step 3

: Tap in the area of the airport that you want to add the start location to (you may have to press and hold), this will place a white cursor **(2)**. Adjust this as required and then tap "Add Object" **(3)**



Tip

: You might need to "freeze" lines and pavements to avoid these being selected when tapping on your screen. To do this tap "Edit > Freeze All Lines / Freeze All Pavements"
