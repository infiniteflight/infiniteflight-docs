# 7.2 Properties



### 7.2.1

Step 1

: Select the start location by tapping on or near it *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 2

: You may have to select the start location from a drop down box if there are multiple items in close proximity. The outline of the start location will turn magenta to indicate it has been selected **(1)**



Step 3

: Tap the "Properties" tab **(2)** on the right side of the screen

Step 4

: You can then adjust the following properties for start locations:

| Button               | Function                                                     | Notes                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Terminal             | You can name the terminal using this field                   | This **must**{.red} be the name of the general area the spawn is located in (such as Terminal/Concourse/GA/Cargo/Apron/FBO etc.) |
| Ramp Size            | The maximum size aircraft category that can spawn and park on that stand is determined with this setting | See [1.3](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/1.-introduction/1.3-aircraft-categories) above |
| Ramp Start Type      | Indicate if this start location is a Gate, Tie-Down, Hangar or Misc | N/A                                                          |
| Ramp Operation Type  | Indicate the primary operational use of the start location   | N/A                                                          |
| Equipment Type       | N/A                                                          | Not required at this time                                    |
| Gate Stops           | Gate stops for different aircraft types at the same start location | See [7.2.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/7.-start-locations/7.2-properties#7.2.2) below |
| Stand Guidance       | N/A                                                          | This is automatically loaded when the app is launched in flight mode |
| Latitude / Longitude | Current latitude/longitude of the start location             | Can be changed to precisely place the start location (e.g. using coordinates from charts) |
| Altitude             | This shows the current altitude (in meters) of the start location | **Should not**{.red} be changed                              |
| Name                 | You can name the gate using this field                       | A format such as "Gate/Stand [alphanumeric/number]" is recommended - Editors **must** ensure that terminal names (e.g. T1) are not included in the "Name" property |



## Gate Stops

### 7.2.2

To add/delete or edit gate stops, the below steps **must**{.red} be followed: 



Step 1

: Tap the "+" symbol next to "Gate Stops" **(1)**



Step 2

: All gate stops currently listed for that start location will appear beneath, if there are none it will be blank. Tap the "+" symbol underneath this on the right to add more **(2)**



Step 3

: A line saying "No Types Specified" will appear. To the left of this will be a "+" symbol **(3)**, tap this to expand the gate stop so aircraft types and the offset can be set

Step 4

: The same symbol will then change to a "-" symbol **(4)**, tap it again to hide this expanded information



Step 5

: When the list is expanded for each gate stop, tap "Aircraft Type" **(5)** to add aircraft types, a list will appear that you can add from



Step 6

: Tap "Offset" **(6)** to add an offset in meters for the gate stop, this will be the distance from the start location to the point that you want certain aircraft types to stop at



Step 7

: You will then see the new gate stop appear with the aircraft types applicable



Tip

: If multiple aircraft have the same offset, add all these aircraft types to one stop gate rather than making multiple ones
