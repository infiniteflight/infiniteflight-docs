# 7.1 Editing Taxiways



Tip

: Whenever you connect buildings/lines/pavements, you **must**{.red} use the "Snap" function to avoid gaps and/or overlapping *(see [2.1.4](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.4) above)*  



## Creating a Taxiway

### 7.1.1

Step 1

: Tap "Taxiways" and then "Create Taxiway Line" **(1)**



Step 2

: Tap in the area of the airport that you want a taxiway line **(2)**, the first node will be placed



Step 3

: Continue to tap to add nodes **(3)**, a taxiway line will continue to be drawn between the nodes

Tip

: Avoid creating long sections of straight lines with no nodes near gates, or pilots could suffer issues with the auto pushback feature

Tip

: Use the walls of a shipping container to help make 90 degree corners

## Editing an Existing Line

### 7.1.2

Step 1

: Select the taxiway by tapping on or near the line, you may have to select the taxiway from a drop down list if there are multiple items in the vicinity *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 2

: Tap the "Modify Shape" button on the right side **(1)**



Step 3

: The line will turn magenta when selected and nodes will appear



Step 4

: By tapping a node it will turn magenta **(2)** to show it has been selected *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 5

: You can then tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to move the node(s) into the desired position



Step 6

: When editing is complete, tap "Modify Shape" to deselect it (you will be unable to edit other taxiways without doing this)

Tip

: If a line has too many nodes for, use the Simplify option under Line Options



## Moving/Changing Orientation of Taxiway

### 7.1.3

Step 1

: Select the taxiway by tapping on or near the taxiway *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 2

: You may have to select the taxiway from a drop down box if there are multiple in close proximity. The outline of the taxiway will turn magenta to indicate it has been selected **(1)**



Tip

: If you have only just made the taxiway then just tap "Modify Shape" to deselect this and the taxiway will be selected



Step 3

: Two circles will appear as well as a compass rose. Tap and hold on the circle **(2)** to move the taxiway or to change orientation:



| Circle | Function                                                     |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Center | Will move the taxiway by dragging your finger to the desired location |
| Outer  | Will change the orientation of the taxiway by dragging your finger in the direction you want to orientate it to |

## Copy & Pasting a Taxiway

### 7.1.4

Step 1

: Select the taxiway by tapping on or near the taxiway *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*

Step 3

: Tap "Edit" and then "Copy" from the management buttons **(1)** on the left side of the screen 



Step 4

: Tap in the area of the airport that you want to add the copied taxiway to, this will place a white cursor **(2)**. Adjust this as required and then tap "Paste"

## Deleting a Taxiway

### 7.1.5

Step 1

: Select the taxiway by tapping on or near the taxiway *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 2

: You may have to select the taxiway from a drop down box if there are multiple in close proximity. The outline of the taxiway will turn magenta to indicate it has been selected **(1)**



Step 3

: Tap "Delete Selection" from the edit buttons **(2)** on the right side of the screen

## Splitting Lines

### 7.1.6

Each line can only have one set of properties, therefore whenever the property of a line changes, you will need a new line. It is recommended to always start with one long line drawn, and then use the "split" function to break the line up (to avoid having to create lots of separate lines manually), follow the steps below to do this:



Step 1

: Tap the line that you want to split and then "Modify Shape" on the right of the screen



Step 2

: Select the node that you want to split



Step 3

: Tap "Split Line"



Step 4

: When splitting the line for the turn, it must be done at the node just as the line starts to "break off"



Tip

: It is usually easiest to set the properties of the line to what is present at the node numbered "0". You can then choose where to split the line, this node will become the new "0" and you can then change the properties for the remaining section of line. This process can then be repeated until the entire line properties have been adjusted as required

## Reverse a Line

### 7.1.7

Should the nodes on a line run the wrong way, they can be reversed. (0,1,2) turns into  (2,1,0)

Step 1

: Tap the line that you want to reverse



Step 2

: Tap on "Line Options"



Step 3

: Tap "Reverse"

## Simplify a Line

### 7.1.8

Should there be too many nodes on a line such as a curve, the simplify tool can be used to reduce the number of nodes while maintaining the shape of the curve

Step 1

: Tap the line that you want to simplify



Step 2

: Tap on "Line Options"



Step 3

: Tap "Simplify"

## Straighten a Line

### 7.1.7

If a section of line has multiple nodes that need to be in a perfectly straight line, you can use the straighten tool to straighten out any line (or section of a line)

Step 1

: Tap the line that you want to straighten

Step 2

: Select the all the nodes that need to be in a straight line

Step 3

: Tap on "Line Options"

Step 4

: Tap "Straighten"
