# 7.3 Taxiway Network

### 7.3.1

The taxiway network allows ATC taxi instructions to be sent to aircraft from controllers in-app using the paths that are generated.

The taxiway network **must**{.red} be built prior to uploading an airport for review



## Taxiway Connections

### 7.3.2

Taxiway connections are required to make a continuous path for guiding aircraft using the taxiway network. They are invisible lines that join taxiways together that are not physically connected. This allows the system to know that it can be used as a path to direct aircraft from the runway to the stand (and vice versa). Taxiway connections are required in the following cases:



- Start locations that are not physically connected to the taxiway line
- Runway crossings where there is not a physical line that directly crosses the runway (not including "line up" lines)
- Or self-positioning stand where there is no physical line to direct aircraft back to the taxiway after parking
- Pushback points that don't have a physical line connecting them to the stand or main taxiway centreline


These connections are allowed to overlap other lines if the node/line count would be reduced by doing so

Tip

: When creating taxiway connections, Editors **should**{.red} attempt to create lines that look similar to what physical taxiway lines would actually look like if they were present IRL as these can be seen on the airport maps when flying in-app



### 7.3.3

Below are the steps that **must**{.red} be followed to create these:



Step 1

: Tap "Taxiways > Create Connection" 



Step 2

: Tap in the area of the airport that you want a taxiway connection, the first node will be placed



Step 3

: Continue to tap to add nodes, a taxiway line will continue to be drawn between the nodes



Tip

: Whenever you connect buildings/lines/pavements, you **must**{.red} use the "Snap" function to avoid gaps and/or overlapping *(see [2.1.4](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.4) above)*  



## Building Taxiway Network

### 7.3.4

After naming all taxiways/hold lines, assigning the taxiway network usage and drawing all taxiway connections, you can build the taxiway network as described below:

Tip

: For airports with no runway hold lines, add temporary hold lines to verify the rest of the taxiway network is correct. These can then be removed before uploading for review



Step 1

: Tap "Taxiways > Build Layout"



> This process can take up to 15 minutes if the airport is large



Step 2

: Then tap "Taxiways > Check Layout". Each start location will show a list of all runways, and these will be color coded to indicate if it has a valid path to that runway: 

| Color  | Meaning                                                      |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Red    | Does not have valid path to the runway edge                  |
| Orange | Valid path to the hold short line but does not reach the runway edge |
| Green  | Valid path to the runway edge                                |



Step 3

: If a runway is shown in red, the Editor will need to recheck the routing to troubleshoot

> Editors **must not**{.red} fix issues by simply renaming lines to "APRON" or by splitting longer taxiway lines into smaller pieces (Unless taxiway properties require this)



Step 4

: Once changes have been made, the layout will need to be rebuilt before the layout can be rechecked (i.e. repeating steps 1 and 2)



Step 5

: Check that Airport Properties *(see [3.2.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/3.-getting-started/3.2-airport-properties#3.2.2) above)* has the "Taxiway Routes Available" tick box selected (orange tick when selected) by tapping "File > Airport Properties > Taxiway Routes Available"



> Taxiway networks will not work in flight mode for controllers/pilots until this tick box is selected

Tip

: Your local save of the taxiway network is used when you control. Using the training/IFATC servers can be a great way to troubleshoot taxiway routing issues
