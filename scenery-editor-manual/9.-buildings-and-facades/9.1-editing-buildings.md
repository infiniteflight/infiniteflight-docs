# 9.1 Editing Buildings

Buildings in Infinite Flight are created from building parts. Each part is defined by at least 2 nodes and a height in meters
(See below)

A roof can also be added if a building part contains at least 3 nodes. Other object properties can be edited, such as name, if the part should be enclosed and height
(See [9.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/9.-buildings-and-facades/9.2-properties.md))

Each building part can be assigned a texture
(See [9.3](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/9.-buildings-and-facades/9.3-editing-facades.md))

Stacking multiple building parts together is known as "layering" and can be used to create complicated buildings
(See [9.4](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/9.-buildings-and-facades/9.4-layering))



Tip

: Whenever you connect buildings/lines/pavements, you **must**{.red} use the "Snap" function to avoid gaps and/or overlapping *(see [2.1.4](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.4) above)*  



## Selecting and Placing a Building

### 9.1.1

Step 1

: Tap "Building Parts" and then "Create Building Part" **(1)** from the management buttons on the left



Step 2

: Tap in the area of the airport that you want a building **(2)**, the first node will be placed



Step 3

: Continue to tap to add nodes **(3-5)**, once 2 nodes are placed a wall will be created, add more nodes to add more walls as required



Step 4

: Walls are only visible on one side, If the walls appears "inside out", you can tap "Line Options" > "Reverse Points" on the right side of the screen which will reverse the numbering of all points 

Step 5

: If you need to enclose the building, open the properties tab and tick the "Closed" checkbox. A wall connecting the last node to the first will appear. See [9.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/9.-buildings-and-facades/9.2-properties.md) for additional properties such as height and roof types

Tip

: Use Angle Snapping to get perfect angles (Right Menu > Snap > Angle Snapping On/Off). Angle snapping will snap at 5 degree increments


## Editing an Existing Buildings Shape

### 9.1.2

Step 1

: Select the building by tapping on or near the building, you may have to select the building from a drop down list if there are multiple items in the vicinity *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*

Step 2

: The outlines of the walls will turn red when selected

Step 3

: Tap the "Modify Shape" button on the right side **(1)**. the nodes making up the building part will be displayed


Step 4

: By tapping a node it will turn magenta **(2)** to show it has been selected *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 5

: You can then tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to move the node(s) into the desired position



Tip

: When moving around the airport, you notice rendering issues with the buildings (i.e. a "judder" motion), the building is duplicated and one will need to be selected and deleted to fix this



Step 6

: When editing is complete, tap "Modify Shape" to deselect it (you will be unable to edit other buildings without doing this)

## Moving a Building

### 9.1.3

Step 1

: Select the building by tapping on or near the building, you may have to select the building from a drop down list if there are multiple items in the vicinity *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Tip

: If you have only just made the building part then just tap "Modify Shape" to deselect this and the building part will be selected



Step 2

: Three circles will appear as well as a compass rose. Tap and hold on the circle **(1)** to move the building or to change height/orientation:



| Circle                         | Function                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Center                         | Will move the building by dragging your finger to the desired location |
| Top (just above center circle) | Will adjust the elevation or altitude of the building        |
| Outer                          | Will change the orientation of the building by dragging your finger in the direction you want to orientate it to |

## Copy & Pasting a Building

### 9.1.4

Step 1

: Select the building by tapping on or near the building, you may have to select the building from a drop down list if there are multiple items in the vicinity *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 2

: Tap "Edit" and then "Copy" **(1)** on the right side of the screen 



Step 3

: Tap in the area of the airport that you want to add the copied building to, this will place a white cursor **(2)**. Adjust this as required and then tap "Paste" **(3)**

## Deleting a Building

### 9.1.5

Step 1

: Select the building by tapping on or near the building, you may have to select the building from a drop down list if there are multiple items in the vicinity *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 2

: Tap the "Delete Selection" button **(1)** on the right side of the screen


![Image 9.1.5.1 - Deleting a Building](_images/manual/scenery-editor/buildings-and-facades/editing-buildings-deleting.png)



## Downloading OSM for Building Placement

Tip

: If using OSM, it will automatically place the buildings when downloaded *(see [3.1.4](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/3.-getting-started/3.1-first-steps#3.1.4) above)* however you may find that they do not completely align with pavements and will need to be moved



### 9.1.6

Open Street Map (OSM) can also be used for importing buildings automatically by following the steps below. Once added, they can be edited in the same way as buildings that have been added manually:



Step 1

: Download the OSM data by tapping "File" **(1)** and then "Download OSM" **(2)**


![Image 9.1.6.1 - Downloading OSM](_images/manual/frames/6.1.5.1a.png)



Tip

: If you have previously downloaded the OSM but subsequently delete some buildings in error (and these changes are saved), it may be more appropriate to use "Download OSM at Cursor". This option will only download the data within 200m of the cursor on the map, and may help avoid duplicate buildings being downloaded (which could result from using the "Download OSM" button)



Step 2

: Delete all buildings outside of the airport boundary *(see [9.1.5](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/9.-buildings-and-facades/9.1-editing-buildings.md#9.1.5) above)*



Tip

: Remember to regularly save and upload your work. You can do this by tapping "File > Save" and then to upload your work tap "File > File Manager > Upload [as Draft/for Review]" *(see [2.1.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.2) above)*
