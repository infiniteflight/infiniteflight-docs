| :fa-check-circle: Add buildings within the airport boundary, including prominent buildings outside the airport fence which are visible for the pilots and contribute to the character of the airport | :fa-times-circle: Create sloped roofs using excessive amounts of layered buildings |
| :fa-check-circle: Use layering to create custom facades      | :fa-times-circle: Add irrelevant buildings outside the airport boundary and buildings which are not visible to pilots |
| :fa-check-circle: Remove roofs for layers of which the roof and floors are invisible to the user | :fa-times-circle: Create multi-story car parks from multiple individual buildings (for each floor). Use the available car park texture instead |
| :fa-check-circle: Snap Buildings to avoid gaps or overlapping | :fa-times-circle: Add any types of “easter eggs”             |
| -                                                            | :fa-times-circle: Make numbers/letters out of buildings      |

Tip

: Whenever you connect buildings/lines/pavements, you **must**{.red} use the "Snap" function to avoid gaps and/or overlapping *(see [2.1.4](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.4) above)*  



## Selecting and Placing a Building

### 9.1.1

Step 1

: Tap "Building" and then "Create Building" **(1)** from the management buttons on the left



Step 2

: Tap in the area of the airport that you want a building **(2)**, the first node will be placed



Step 3

: Continue to tap to add nodes **(3)**, once three or more are placed, a section of building will be created



Step 4

: If the building appears "inside out", you can tap "Reverse Points" on the right side of the screen which will reverse the numbering of all points

Tip

: Use the walls of a shipping container to help make 90 degree corners

## Editing an Existing Buildings Shape

### 9.1.2

Step 1

: Select the building by tapping on or near the building, you may have to select the building from a drop down list if there are multiple items in the vicinity *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 2

: Tap the "Modify Shape" button on the right side **(1)**



Step 3

: The outline will turn red when selected and nodes will appear



Step 4

: By tapping a node it will turn magenta **(2)** to show it has been selected *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 5

: You can then tap, hold and then drag your finger on the screen to move the node(s) into the desired position



Tip

: When moving around the airport, you notice rendering issues with the buildings (i.e. a "judder" motion), the building is duplicated and one will need to be selected and deleted to fix this



Step 6

: When editing is complete, tap "Modify Shape" to deselect it (you will be unable to edit other buildings without doing this)

## Changing Orientation of a Building

### 9.1.3

Step 1

: Select the building by tapping on or near the building, you may have to select the building from a drop down list if there are multiple items in the vicinity *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Tip

: If you have only just made the taxiway/pavement then just tap "Modify Shape" to deselect this and the taxiway/pavement will be selected



Step 2

: Three circles will appear as well as a compass rose. Tap and hold on the circle **(1)** to move the building or to change height/orientation:



| Circle                         | Function                                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Center                         | Will move the building by dragging your finger to the desired location |
| Top (just above center circle) | Will adjust the elevation or altitude of the building        |
| Outer                          | Will change the orientation of the building by dragging your finger in the direction you want to orientate it to |

## Copy & Pasting a Building

### 9.1.4

Step 1

: Select the building by tapping on or near the building, you may have to select the building from a drop down list if there are multiple items in the vicinity *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 2

: Tap "Edit" and then "Copy" **(1)** on the right side of the screen 



Step 3

: Tap in the area of the airport that you want to add the copied building to, this will place a white cursor **(2)**. Adjust this as required and then tap "Paste" **(3)**

## Deleting a Building

### 9.1.5

Step 1

: Select the building by tapping on or near the building, you may have to select the building from a drop down list if there are multiple items in the vicinity *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 2

: Tap the "Delete Selection" button **(1)** on the right side of the screen



![Image 9.1.5.1 - Deleting a Building](_images/manual/frames/6.1.4.1b.png)



## Downloading OSM for Building Placement

Tip

: If using OSM, it will automatically place the buildings when downloaded *(see [3.1.4](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/3.-getting-started/3.1-first-steps#3.1.4) above)* however you may find that they do not completely align with pavements and will need to be moved



### 9.1.6

Open Street Map (OSM) can also be used for importing buildings automatically by following the steps below. Once added, they can be edited in the same way as buildings that have been added manually:



Step 1

: Download the OSM data by tapping "File" **(1)** and then "Download OSM" **(2)**



![Image 9.1.6.1 - Downloading OSM](_images/manual/frames/6.1.5.1a.png)



Tip

: If you have previously downloaded the OSM but subsequently delete some buildings in error (and these changes are saved), it may be more appropriate to use "Download OSM at Cursor". This option will only download the data within 200m of the cursor on the map, and may help avoid duplicate buildings being downloaded (which could result from using the "Download OSM" button)



Step 2

: Delete all buildings outside of the airport boundary by tapping on or near the blue circle that is in the center of the building **(3)** and then tapping "Delete Selection" **(4)** on the right side of the screen *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



![Image 9.1.6.2 - Deleting OSM Buildings](_images/manual/frames/deleting-osm-buildings.png)



Tip

: Remember to regularly save and upload your work. You can do this by tapping "File > Save" and then to upload your work tap "File > File Manager > Upload [as Draft/for Review]" *(see [2.1.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.2) above)*
