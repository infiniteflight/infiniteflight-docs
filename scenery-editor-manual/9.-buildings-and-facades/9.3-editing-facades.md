# 9.3 Editing Facades


<!-- Pretty Much all this needs rewriting -->

### 9.3.1

Currently you cannot use different styles on the same building, only different faces of one style. Therefore to be able to use different styles, creating buildings using multiple smaller buildings (i.e. "layering") is the only way to do this *(see 9.4 below)*.



### 9.3.2

Step 1

: Select the building by tapping on or near the building (you may have to select the building from a drop down list if there are multiple items in the vicinity)



Step 2

: Tap the "Building" button **(1)** on the left side of the screen, and then "Set Texture & Facades" **(2)**

Step 4

: Tap the bottom left hand button **(3)** to select a different style 



Step 5

: The building will automatically change all faces to match the style selected and will be surrounded by red lines that join each node. To change individual sides, tap one of these red **(4)** lines, it will turn magenta to show it is selected *(or use the rectangle selection tool - see [2.1.6](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/2.-user-interface/2.1-editor-screen#2.1.6) above)*



Step 6

: Scroll up/down the list on the left of the screen to see the different faces available for that style



Step 7

: Select the desired face and then tap "Assign" **(5)**. It will not let you assign a face without one or more sides of a building selected
