# 9.3 Editing Facades



### 9.3.1

Currently you can only set 1 facade or "face" per building part. To create buildings with different faces layering should be used see [9.4](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/9.-buildings-and-facades/9.4-layering) for more information 



### 9.3.2

Step 1

: Select the building by tapping on or near the building (you may have to select the building from a drop down list if there are multiple items in the vicinity)



Step 2

: Tap the "Building Texturing" button **(1)** on the right side panel


Step 3

: Tap the bottom left hand button **(2)** to select a different building style. Scroll as necessary, tap to view the different faces in that building style


Step 4

: Scroll up/down the list on the right of the screen **(3)** to see the different faces available for that style



Step 5

: Select the desired face and then tap "Assign" **(4)**. All walls of the selected building part(s) will be changed

Tip

: You can see and select previous faces used in your current editing session on the left side **(5)** of the panel. Just tap and hit assign
