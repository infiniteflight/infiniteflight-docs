# 9.4 Layering

<!-- Explain what layering is here -->
Layering is the process of using multiple building parts to create one building, this is necessary due to each building part only being able to support one texture. 



### 9.4.1

<!-- REDO ALL OF THIS -->

The below steps highlight a good method for adding detail to buildings (layering) however you may find different methods that you prefer:



Step 1

: Change the building height *(see [9.2.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/9.-buildings-and-facades/9.2-properties#9.2.1) above)*. If it is a hangar you can use the minimum hangar heights for guidance *(see [9.2.2](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/9.-buildings-and-facades/9.2-properties#9.2.2) above)*. For terminals or other complicated buildings, it is better to create multiple levels. Any level that is not the top floor should have the roof type set to "none" *(see [9.2.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/9.-buildings-and-facades/9.2-properties#9.2.1) above)*



> If the lowest layer of a building is floating (i.e. not touching the ground level) such as a bridge, this layer **must not**{.red} have its roof type set to "none" as this will create a layer without a floor



Step 2

: If making multiple floors, first copy & paste the first layer of the building *(see [9.1.4](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/9.-buildings-and-facades/9.1-editing-buildings#9.1.4) above)*




Step 3

: Using the management buttons on the left of the screen, tap "Object" and then "Auto Altitude". This will raise the newly copied building to make it the second layer (roof height of the first layer). You can also set the height of the building manually if needed for the same effect *(see [9.2.1](/guide/scenery-editor-manual/9.-buildings-and-facades/9.2-properties#9.2.1) above)*



> When you layer buildings, you **must**{.red} ensure that the lower layer ends at the same point as the next layer starts to prevent any overlapping of facades. This also applies for pillars under floating buildings



Step 4

: Using external sources, continue to adjust the size and shapes of the layers to replicate the overall look of the building. For passenger terminals a minimum of three layers is recommended



Step 5

: With every new layer added, don't forget to check the corners of the building have been snapped correctly to ensure that the layers are aligned



Tip

: Don't forget that you can also make layers that are a small height (no less than 1 meter), this will give you the option of changing the roof colour for example without the overall facade look changing. Editors **should**{.red} however, use the minimum amount of layers possible to achieve the most realistic look

### 9.4.2

 When you layer buildings, you **must**{.red} ensure that the lower layer ends at the same point as the next layer starts to prevent any overlapping of facades. This also applies for pillars under floating buildings

The below image is an example of how overlapping building parts are displayed in app. This **must**{.red} be avoided

To avoid the above, no building parts should overlap. The same also applies to roofs set to the same height
