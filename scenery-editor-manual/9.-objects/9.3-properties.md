| Button               | Function                                                     | Notes                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Scale                | Tap the "+/-" symbols to adjust the scale of the object      | Really useful for making objects match in size what you see from external sources (e.g. lighting AC units and blast deflectors etc.). The scaling on jet bridges **must not**{.red} be changed |
| Orientation          | Tap the "+/-" symbols to adjust the orientation of the object |                                                              |
| Animations           | This will show if an object (such as a jetbridge) has built in animations |                                                              |
| Latitude / Longitude | Current latitude/longitude of the building                   |                                                              |
| Altitude             | This shows the current altitude (in meters) of the object. Tap the number and then enter in a new value to adjust this | Always based on the bottom of the surface they you are working from. Can be adjusted here manually or go to Object > auto altitude if you're doing layering for example |
| Name                 | You can name the object using this field                     |                                                              |
